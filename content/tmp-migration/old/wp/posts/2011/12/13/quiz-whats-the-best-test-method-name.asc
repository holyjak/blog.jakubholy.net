Which of the following names of test methods do you think to be the best?<br><br>[polldaddy poll=5757187]<br><br>(Notice that we could leave out "payment_" from the last name if it is clear from the context, i.e. from the fixture [a fancy name for test class] name.)<br><br>According to the holy book of <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code</a>, the code should make visible the <em>intent</em> as much as possible. According to the testing guru Kent B., a test should be <em>telling a story</em> to its reader - a story about how the code should be used and function. According to these two and my own experiences from reading a lot of (test) core written by other people, the last one is absolutely the best. However you have the right to disagree and discuss :-)<br><br>PS: I firmly believe that calling a test method "<em>test()</em>" should be punishable.
