You don't need to be afraid of the foretold end of the world in 2012. To end the world is a big project and I think we can easily compare it to large scale IT projects. Consequently:
<ol>
	<li>Such a large-scale change certainly wont't be delivered on time. Most likely it will take several times longer, i.e. we can expect it around 2020 earliest.</li>
	<li>Anyway it will be necessary to downsize it considerably, so don't expect a complete destruction of everything to take place.</li>
	<li>Most likely the project will be canceled at the end.</li>
</ol>
So calm down :-)<br><br>PS: I hope they won't try to go with agile, I wouldn't appreciate frequent deliveries :-)
