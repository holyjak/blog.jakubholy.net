Dialogs in the popular rich-text wysiwyg JavaScript editor <a href="https://ckeditor.com/">CKEditor</a> 3.5.2 are fixed-positioned and thus when you scroll the editor's page they always stay in the middle as you can see in its <a href="https://ckeditor.com/demo">demo</a>. That is a problem if the dialog is longer then the height of the page because you will be never able to scroll to its end (where the Ok/Cancle buttons are located).<br><br>It could be perhaps solved by adding a scrollbar to the dialog but I solved it by overriding the dialog's <em>position: fixed</em> with <em>position: absolute</em>. Here is how to do it.<!--more--><br><br>Add the following to the <a href="https://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Developers_Guide/Setting_Configurations">CKEditor's configuration</a> (either directly when you instantiate it or into a custom config, if you have one):<br><br><pre><code>
CKEDITOR.on('dialogDefinition', function(e) {
    var dialogName = e.data.name;
    var dialogDefinition = e.data.definition;
    dialogDefinition.dialog.parts.dialog.setStyles(
        {
            position : 'absolute'
        });
});
</code></pre><br><br>(I've copied the idea of using the on dialogDefinition event from a source I don't remember.)
<h2>Explanation</h2>
The div and table, which constitute the two top-level elements of a dialog, are created in themes/default/theme.js in the method buildDialog(editor). This method is called from dialog/plugin.js where these elements are further modified, including the following:<br><br><pre><code>
var themeBuilt = editor.theme.buildDialog( editor );
...
this.parts = themeBuilt.parts;
...
// Set the startup styles for the dialog, avoiding it enlarging the
// page size on the dialog creation.
this.parts.dialog.setStyles(
	{
		position : CKEDITOR.env.ie6Compat ? 'absolute' : 'fixed',
		top : 0,
		left: 0,
		visibility : 'hidden'
	});
...
this.definition = definition = CKEDITOR.fire( 'dialogDefinition', ...).definition;
</code></pre><br><br>We make use of the fired event to modify the dialog's definition to our liking, overriding the position to be always absolute.<br><br><a href="https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/2127">Why CKEditor uses position: fixed</a> is explained in its ticket #2127.
