The end of our one-month iteration approached and the levels of fear and agitation started to rise. What will happen when we deploy it? Will everything crash? Will all hell break loose? Will there be a flood of midnight severity-one issues? Will the features developed work together or are there going to be unexpected and fatal interactions?<br><br>What is funny about this story, you certainly ask? You know these pains of deployment too and there is nothing funny about them.<br><br>Well, the funny thing is that I was used to quarterly releases and considered them completely normal and OK. Afterwards, I got used to bi-weekly releases and now I consider even monthly releases way too long (and I actually wouldn't mind weekly releases). The conclusion? Once you see how easy and better things can be, you will always feel pain when you need to step back.
