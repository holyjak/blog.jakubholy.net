The <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/jeeutils/index.php?title=DbUnit_Express">DbUnit Express</a> 1.3.0 (a thin wrapper around DbUnit to speed up DB testing) released today introduces features that make it even easier to write a DB unit test, the most interesting ones are the introduction of EmbeddedDbTesterRule which can automatically execute its onSetup thanks to JUnit's @Rule (<a href="https://github.com/holyjak/dbunit-express/blob/master/src/test/java/net/jakubholy/dbunitexpress/EmbeddedDbTesterRuleTest.java">example</a>) and the addition of setDataSet(fileName), which searches for a data set file of the given name on the classpath etc. and loads it.<br><br>See the updated <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/jeeutils/index.php?title=DbUnit_Express">project page</a> and <a href="https://github.com/holyjak/dbunit-express/tree/master/src/test/java/net/jakubholy/dbunitexpress">example tests</a>.<br><br>Other changes of interest:
<ol>
	<li>The project was now officially renamed to dbunit-express (and root package changed to net.jakubholy.dbunitexpress), so update your Maven dependencies and code</li>
	<li>Upgraded to latest DbUnit (2.4.8, was 2.4.7)</li>
	<li>Added slf4j-simple to dependencies so that users don't need to do it themselves anymore - those who don't want it may just exclude it</li>
	<li>Added EmbeddedDbTesterRule which can call its onSetup automatically under JUnit 4</li>
	<li>Added setDataSet(String) that tries to find a file of the given name in testData/ or on the classpath and loads it</li>
	<li>When there is a FileNotFoundException for the ddl, report the working directory, check if testData/ self exists</li>
	<li>Added comment to onTearDown() saying that it does nothing and thus doesn't need to be called, updated test classes accordingly</li>
	<li>Added SimpleNonExtendingEmbeddedDbJUnit4Test to show usage with JUnit 4</li>
	<li>When it is detected in onSetup() that the test database likely isn't initialized, we advice to use Db Creator and report the current working directory</li>
	<li>Added method findConfigFile(name) to simplify custom DataSet creation, location of DDL files etc.</li>
	<li>Added DatabaseCreator.loadDdl(name) to load an additional DDL, you can also use <em>new DatabaseCreator().setDdlFile("fileOnClasspathOrInTestData.ddl").doCreateAndInitializeTestDb()</em> to init the DB from a custom DDL</li>
</ol>
<div>PS: As you might have noticed, the project was migrated to GitHub because I couldn't stand Subversion anymore. Its inability to deal with deleted folders was killing me.</div>
