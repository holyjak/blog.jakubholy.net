I've spent great and inspiring years in <a href="https://www.ibacz.eu/-English-">IBA CZ</a> while working also with IBM Austria and I'm very thankful to all the nice people there, but it's time to move on. I always wanted to spend couple of years abroad to broaden my views and finally our choice has fallen on Norway. So on 2/1 I'm starting to work in Oslo with <a href="https://www.iterate.no/">Iterate AS</a> (<a href="https://www.iterate.pl/en/">en</a>), which is a very attractive company, among others thanks to their true agile development involvement. You may not hear from me for a while as I'll be busy accommodating to the new environment and learning Norwegian but be sure that earlier or later I'll be back with more interesting blogs.<br><br>Ha det bra!
