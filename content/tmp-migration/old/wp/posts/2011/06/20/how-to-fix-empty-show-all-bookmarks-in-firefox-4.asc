Since recently I was unable to edit my bookmarks because Bookmarks -&gt; Show all bookmarks displayed en empty list of bookmarks, though the bookmarks were under the bookmarks menu, B. toolbar etc. The Bookmarks side panel was also empty though.<br><br>The solution was to create a <strong>backup of my bookmarks</strong> (in the json format), stop FF, <strong>delete places.sqlite</strong> from my profile, start FF and <strong>restore</strong> bookmarks from the backup.<br><br><!--more-->I first tried to run FF in the <a href="https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Safe%20Mode">safe mode</a> but it didn't help (yet it was useful for it ruled out an evil addon as the cause). I next <a href="https://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_manager">created a new profile</a> and found out that the bookmark manager behaved properly there (I had of course no bookmarks but "All bookmarks" contained the Bookmark Menu and B. Toolbar instead of being completely empty).
