I hope everybody is enjoying the holiday and not spending hours on tech blogs and sites. At least I do :-) and thus this month's list is a short one:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://piotrjagielski.com/blog/working-with-static-imports-in-eclipse/">Working With Static Imports in Eclipse</a> - how to make working with static imports (nearly) as easy as with the normal ones (especially useful for fluent interfaces and "DSLs"), mainly by adding types like JUnit's Assert and Mockito to your favorite imports and setting Eclipse to always generate static imports in the form &lt;type&gt;.*</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.dzone.com/links/r/5_things_you_didnt_know_about_java_database_conne.html">5 things you didn't know about ... Java Database Connectivity</a> - it was interesting to learn that JDBC specifies some scalar functions that drivers <em>may</em> support and translate into the DB's language such as "{CURRENT_DATE()}"; for common functions supported by most drivers this should make your implementation more portable</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.dzone.com/links/r/four_things_to_remember_about_javalangstring.html">Four Things to Remember about java.lang.String</a> - a really good one thanks to information on how to compare correctly the same Unicode character/string that can be encoded in different ways with java.text.Normalizer.normalize and Locale-sensitive comparison ignoring optionally unimportant differences such as letter size and accents (using a Collator)</li>
</ul>
