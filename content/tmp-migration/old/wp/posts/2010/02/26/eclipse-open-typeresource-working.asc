Some weeks ago the extremely useful features of Eclipse Open Type and Open Resource stopped working, throwing an uninformative&nbsp; Error instead, no matter which version or JRE vendor. I was desperate. Until finally I found a <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=240033">bug regarding this issue</a> which pointed me to the solution - switching off Gnome's assistive technologies (System - Preferences - Assistive Technologies - uncheck Enable assistive technologies under my Ubuntu 9.04 Jaunty). Thanks, allmighty powers of digitalized universe!
