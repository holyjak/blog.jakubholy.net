The last month's list of interesting articles is a bit shorter due to off-line holidays, which I enjoyed much more then reading articles :-)
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://blog.solidcraft.eu/2010/05/boy-scout-rule-in-practice.html">Boy Scout Rule in practice</a> - improving the code on the go with respect to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code</a>'s and similar best practices: 1) If you spot a piece of code to improve, don't add a TODO there - fix it immediately; 2) A nice example of refactoring a 30 lines method based on the Single Responsibility and Short Method principles</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp05236.html">Java theory and practice: Dealing with InterruptedException - You caught it, now what are you going to do with it?</a> - why not to swallow an InterruptedException and how to deal with it properly (namely by rethrowing it or calling Thread.currentThread().interrupt() to reset the Thread's interrupted status). This is not a new article, but the subject is little known yet raher important.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.focus.com/images/view/11905/">WTF is HTML5 and why we should care?</a> - a visually appealing 1-page summary of what HTML 5 brings and its current and future support in major browsers and IE. Related: <a href="https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/index.html#contents">the current draft of the HTML5 spec</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.drdobbs.com/web-development/225300318?pgno=1">Dr Dobbs' HTML 5 Primer</a> - an overview of the technologies and standards that form the "HTML 5 Family" and are commonly referred to as HTML 5 though not being a part of the core HTML 5 standard. Not long and good to make the HTML5 fuss a bit clearer.</li>
