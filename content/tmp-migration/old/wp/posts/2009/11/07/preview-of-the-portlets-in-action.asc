<p>The book Portlets in Action being written by Ashish Sarin, which I've already mentioned and which looks really promising, has been made <a href="https://www.manning.com/sarin/">available via the Manning Early Access</a> Program. As of today there are two chapters available and you can read the first one &quot;<a href="https://www.manning.com/sarin/Sarin_MEAP_Ch1.pdf" target="_blank">Introducing Portals and Portlets</a>&quot; for free.</p><p>What I find to be the most attractive features of this book is that it concentrates on the &quot;new&quot; JSR 286 also known as Portlets 2.0 and goes beyond teaching portlets with its intorduction of Spring MVC and Ajax libraries suitable for portlets.<br /></p>
