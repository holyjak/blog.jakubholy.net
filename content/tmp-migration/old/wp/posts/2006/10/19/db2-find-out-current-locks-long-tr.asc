To find out current locks in a DB and other information about its current state, you need to take a "snapshot":<br /><br /><pre>db2 "attach to  user  using "</pre><pre>db2 "get snapshot for applications on "  &gt; mydatabase_snapshot.txt</pre><br />Look into the resulting mydatabase_snapshot.txt for "Application ID holding"&nbsp; (if there is a lock, this will read the ID of the aplication holding the lock). To find long queries [that are currently running], look for "Executing".<br /><br />
