When I started with Clojure, I saw a language. Some people, when they look at it, they only see a weird syntax. It took me years to realize that *in truth Clojure is a philosophy*. The language embodies it, the ecosystem embraces it and grows from it, you the developer eventually soak it up.

The philosophy is *simplicity* - on a very profound level - and, to a lesser degree, *ergonomics*. What do I mean by simplicity and ergonomics? Simplicity is about breaking things apart into their elementary constituents that are https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1527393/what-is-orthogonality[orthogonal] to each other. Ergonomics is about making it possible and convenient to combine these elements in arbitrary, powerful ways. You end up with simple things that have single responsibility and that you can combine freely to suit your unique needs. These elements are simple but also generic and thus applicable in many situations and usable in many ways. This is crucial also for flexibility:

> One should not have to modify a working program. One should be able to add to it to implement new functionality or to adjust old functions for new requirements. We call this additive programming. [..] To facilitate additive programming, it is necessary that the parts we build be as simple and general as we can make them.

## Examples

Let's have a look at a few examples of simplicity in practice to get a better grasp on what it actually means.

### Unix tools

The https://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/gnu_linux_tools_guide/the-unix-tools-philosophy.html[Unix tools philosophy] is based on simplicity:

> The tools philosophy was to have small programs to accomplish a particular task instead of trying to develop large monolithic programs to do a large number of tasks. To accomplish more complex tasks, tools would simply be connected together, using pipes.

So you have small, single-purpose elements that share a simple, well-defined, generic interface (lines of text) and thus you can combine them in many ways to achieve many different goals. You can read an access log with `cat`, filter only the requests from a particular IP with `grep`, extract just the response code with `cut`, sort it with `sort`, and get all the unique values with `uniq`. (The `|` interface is great for many purposes but actually too simple for others, which prompted the creation of the https://elv.sh/[Elvish Shell], whose pipes can carry structured data.)

### Clojure

Just a few examples.

Clojure gives you many of the same tools that you get in an OO language such as Java but contrary to these, you get each of them as a separate thing your are free to use and combine with others as you see fit. *Java tangles polymorphism with hierarchy and code sharing* (i.e. inheritance). Java polymorphism dispatches dynamically based on the _type_ of the target object and the inheritance _hierarchy_ thereof. Clojure has two forms of polymorphism, the simpler protocols and the more powerful multimethods. https://clojure.org/reference/multimethods[Multimethods] give you the same possibilities as Java, but separately. Again you dispatch based on a value - though here it is an arbitrary value computed from the function's arguments, not just the type of the first one. Typically these  dispatch values are disjoint but if you want to, then you can define an arbitrary hierarchy of these values using Clojure's https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/derive[`derive`]. (I've never needed that because my needs were simple enough. Clojure allows me to use correspondingly simpler concepts and write simple code while Java forces me to use its more complex concepts because it lacks any simpler ones.)

In Java, *implementing an interface* requires that you have control over the target class. That is an unnecessary and occasionally painful limitation. Clojure has https://clojure.org/reference/protocols[protocols], which are quite similar to interfaces, but you can implement them for a class you do not control. Thus polymorphism in Clojure is independent from code ownership (to an extent). That is very powerful and useful.

A key source of simplicity in Clojure is that all *data is represented by a few generic data structures* and the core library provides tens of powerful functions to work with these and a few abstractions above them. In Java, everything has its own classes with their own, unique methods. The ≈ 100 Clojure collection sequence functions I get to use again and again, with every library and framework I ever use. And similarly I reuse the few key higher-order functions to express powerful transformations. In Java, I have to learn a new "API" for each library and write tons of bespoke glue code to get data to flow from one to another. I have ranted about this before in link:/clojure-vs-java-few-datastructures-over-many-objects/[Clojure vs Java: The benefit of Few Data Structures, Many Functions over Many Unique Classes] where I had to deal with data flowing from `HttpServletRequest` -> Apache `HttpUriRequest` and Apache `HttpResponse` -> `HttpServletResponse`. What does this have to do with simplicity? Clojure only has a few parts, i.e. the 4 core collections, contrary to Java's infinite number of data representations and data access forms. And it empowers you to process them with generic functions that are oblivious to the concrete domain - orthogonal to it - while in Java you are forced to write 100% domain-specific code.

### EDN > JSON, EQL > GraphQL

Extensible Data Notation is a Clojure parallel to JSON but it supports more data types (such as symbols, keywords, sets) and key types and, most importantly, it is extensible through "tagged literals", with some extensions included out of the box such as for dates (ex.: `#inst "2021-06-13`), which JSON is sorely missing, and regular expressions (`#"^Hello*"`).

https://graphql.org/[GraphQL] is a graph data query language with a unique syntax. It is typically embedded in JavaScript as a string. Its Clojure parallel is https://edn-query-language.org/[EDN Query Language]. The big difference is that EQL is expressed using ordinary EDN data structures - because EDN (contrary to JSON) is powerful enough. And thus, contrary to GraphQL, you do not need any special APIs to parse, transform, or programmatically generate these queries. You can simply use the old, good Clojure functions you already use million times a day. You do not need https://dgraph.io/docs/graphql/api/fragments/[anything special to define fragments] - just use data and functions. And your editor can already highlight the syntax of the queries.

### Stu Halloway's Reflect utility

Once upon time, Stu Halloway wanted to add a utility to Clojure to make it easier to explore Java objects, as described e.g. in https://youtu.be/cidchWg74Y4?t=2725[Simplicity Ain't Easy]. This was his second attempt:

```clojure
user=> (describe String  ; <1>
         (named "last")) ; <2>

=========================================
class: java.lang.String
Filters: [(named last)]
=========================================
int lastIndexOf(java.lang.String) public
int lastIndexOf(int) public
...
```
<1> `describe` prints information about a Java class and its methods
<2> We can also filter the methods shown using convenient, clearly named predicates it provides

This solutions is not good enough - it is not simple enough. Here is the final variant:

```clojure
user=>(require '[clojure.reflect :refer [reflect]]
               '[clojure.pprint  :refer [print-table]])
user=> (->> (reflect String)                               ; <1>
            :members                                       ; <2>
            (filter #(.startsWith (str (:name %)) "last")) ; <3>
            (clojure.pprint/print-table))                  ; <4>

|       :name | ... |   :parameter-types | ...
|-------------+-----+---------------------------------...
| lastIndexOf | ... | [java.lang.String] | ...
| lastIndexOf | ... |              [int] | ...
| ...
```

The final solution is far less "pretty" - it requires more code, you need to learn the shape of the data, and are forced to put all the pieces together manually. But it is also far simpler - each part does a single thing and is independent from the others:

1. `reflect` leverages the ubiquitous Clojure interconnection interface - data
2. There is no custom API - use Clojure's general data access to get the subset of data you want
3. There is no custom API for filtering - use Clojure's general data access sequence functions to filter and process the data in any way you want
4. Printing isn't baked into the API anymore. Instead, there is a general purpose printing function that can print any data

What are the pros and cons?

The disadvantage is that it requires more work from you - you need to learn about the pieces (`reflect`, `print-table`) and understand the data they work with and filtering is more verbose. On the other hand, you can add convenience wrappers of your own, ones that fit your needs 100%, should you desire so - because now you can.

The advantage is that you get a generic printing function that you can use for any, completely unrelated, needs and that you get the information about the class as data. Data that you can process leveraging the multitude of functions and libraries you already know and to purposes other than printing, purposes some of which the author could never have expected. And you do not need to learn any new "entity specific language" of method filtering predicates.

## What do we know about simplicity?

* Not tangled
* Not "pretty" - exposed to parts and plumbing, more verbose
* Not "easy" as in familiar
* Hard work and multiple attempts to achieve

### Simplicity ≠ convenience

### Simplicity ain't easy

## Conclusion

- Simplicity - few things, few interdependencies, "small" things

.Simple made easy
