<h1>Broken Eclipse shortcut under Gnome for Occurrences in File</h1><div style="text-align:left;">One of the extremely useful keyboard shortcuts for Eclipse is Shift+Control+U which finds all occurrences of a selected identifier in the current file. Unfortunately&nbsp; this doesn't work under Linux with Gnome because <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ComposeKey#Unicode%20composition" id="o65b" title="Gnome uses this shortcut for composing Unicode">Gnome uses this shortcut for composing Unicode</a> characters. You can check it by typing Shift+Control+U followed by 123 and a space into your browser's address bar: first it will render an underlined <u>u</u> and then a strange g-like character.<br /><br />The conclusion is that you cannot use the shortcut Shift+Control+U and perhaps also a few others (I experienced troubles with Shift+Ctrl+A) in Eclipse under Gnome. You can the shortcut in preferences accessible e.g. via pressing twice Shift+Ctrl+L. For instance Shift+Ctrl+F1 is OK.<br /><br />Environment: Eclipse 3.4/3.5, Ubuntu 9.04 with Gnome 2.26.1.</div><br />
