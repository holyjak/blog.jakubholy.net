In the last month of 2010 I've stumbled upon surprisingly few intersting articles, partly due to having a lot to do in my job.
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://mooneyblog.mmdbsolutions.com/index.php/2010/07/30/reusable-code-is-bad/">Reusable Code Is Bad</a> (for advanced developers only!) - we know duplication is bad but "premature enabling for reuse" is equally bad - or ewen worse - because it introduces more complexity and you most likely aren't going to need it anyway. Apply your experience and knowledge to detect when you will <em>actually benefit</em> from reuse and <em>reduce overall maintenance and complexity</em>. Read the comments too, there're some interesting ones.</li>
</ul>
