We all know that one coarse-grained operation is more efficient than a number of fine-grained ones when communicating over the network boundary but until recently I haven't realized how big that difference may be. While performing a simple query individually for each input record proceeded with the speed of <strong>11k records per hour</strong>, when I grouped each 100 queries together (with "... WHERE id IN (value1, .., value100)), all <strong>200k</strong> records were processed <strong>in 13 minutes</strong>. In other words, using a batch of the size 100 led to the speed-up of nearly two orders of magnitude!<br><br>The moral: It really pays of to spend a little more time on writing the more complex batch-enabled JDBC code whenever dealing with larger amounts of data. (And it wasn't that much more effort thanks to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-pg01115.html">Groovy SQL</a>.)
