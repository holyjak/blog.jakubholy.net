We need to listen for messages distributed via Websphere MQ to get informed when an employee joins or leaves IBM. And because the resources used in the processing (a database, a webservice) may be temporarily unavailable, we must be able to deal with such outages, which may range from minutes to hours, by repeatedly retrying the processing after some delay. And we must be also able to deal with "poison messages", that means messages whose processing always fails either because their content is invalid or because their data isn't consistent with the database. The question is whether this would be better implemented as a Message-Driven Bean (MDB) or a batch job regularly checking its queue given that we have Websphere Application Server 7 (and thus Java EE 5) and Websphere MQ 6, which both have some important changes compared to the previous versions. It turns out that it depends - both approaches have some advantages and disadvantages and so it's a question of the likelihood of particular problems and business requirements and priorities.
<h1><!--more-->Setting the scene</h1>
<h2>MDB vs. a batch job: the decision factors</h2>
Whether we should select the MDB or the batch job approach depends on a number of factors, some of them are:
<ul>
	<li>Requirements
<ul>
	<li>Quantity: What quantity of messages do we need to handle?</li>
	<li>Error likelihood: What's the probability that a resource will be  temporarily unavailable or that a message will contain data that can't be  processed correctly and how soon such a problem needs to be resolved?  ﻿I.e. can we wait to another day or shall we get going as soon as the  resource is up again? This will tell us how often we need to retry and whether a manual handling of an issue is sufficient.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Support for error handling/retrial logic</li>
	<li>Ease of use/development/maintenance</li>
	<li>Performance: We need to handle all the incoming messages and to have minimal negative impact on the  performance of the target system</li>
	<li>Speed of processing of the incoming messages (immediate vs. once or few times per day)</li>
	<li>Integration with our operations monitoring (logging, our Operations Dashboard webapp)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The problems to deal with</h2>
There are three types of problems that can occur:
<ol>
	<li>A failure to communicate with MQ, for instance because a network connection got interrupted</li>
	<li>Inability to process a message due to a resource (a DB or a WS) being temporary unavailable</li>
	<li>A poison (invalid) message (wrong data type, unexpected content) leading to   an exception during its processing</li>
</ol>
<h1>The two approaches</h1>
<h2>Approach 1: A Message-Driven Bean (MDB)</h2>
A MDB is hosted by an application server that does a lot of work on behalf of the bean (such as transaction and concurrency management) thus simplifying its development and configuration. It may be as simple as writing<br><br><pre><code>
@javax.ejb.MessageDriven
public class SimpleMessageBean implements javax.jms.MessageListener {
    public void onMessage(javax.jms.Message inMessage) {
    final javax.jms.TextMessage msg = (javax.jms.TextMessage) inMessage;
    final String msgBody = msg.getText();
    // handle the msgBody ...
   }
}
</code></pre><br><br>and configuring the ActivationSpecification for the MDB in JNDI via the app. server's administration UI.<br><br>The question is, of course, how well it can handle poison messages and retrial when resources are temporarily unavailable.
<h3>MDB error handling and configuration in Websphere 7</h3>
Let's have a look how Websphere deals with various kinds of errors related to MDBs and how we do configure a MDB in this application server, especially with regard to error handling.
<h4>MDB error handling in Websphere</h4>
<strong>What happens when an error occurs</strong>?<br><br>Normally an Application Server starts an MQ <strong>transaction</strong> before it invokes a MDB and it either commits it when the MDB finishes or rolls it back when it throws an exception. If the transaction succeeds then the message is removed from the MDB's queue otherwise it will be returned there and processed again in the future. This is the default behavior corresponding to configuring container-managed transactions (tx) with the type of  'required'. Notice that also <a title="Visit page outside WikiCentral" rel="nofollow" href="https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.express.doc/info/exp/ae/cmb_trans.html">DB operations can participate in this transaction<sup><img src="https://w3.tap.ibm.com/w3ki/images/icons/linkext7.gif" border="0" alt="" width="7" height="7" align="absmiddle" /></sup></a> and thus be committed/rolled back as well, which might be useful.
<ol>
	<li>In the case of an MQ communication/connection failure, WAS logs the  exception and retries the connection later based on its configuration.  It's also possible to set an <a title="Visit page outside WikiCentral" rel="nofollow" href="https://download-llnw.oracle.com/javaee/5/api/javax/jms/ExceptionListener.html">ExceptionListener<sup><img src="https://w3.tap.ibm.com/w3ki/images/icons/linkext7.gif" border="0" alt="" width="7" height="7" align="absmiddle" /></sup></a> that would be called with the exception as a parameter in such a case.</li>
	<li>In the case of an exception during message processing (or due to a manual  setRollbackOnly invocation) the current transaction is rolled back, the  message is put back to the queue and the MDB is restarted. When the  queue is re-checked, the message is found again and passed to another  MDB. If the cause of the problem persists, this will fail again - and so  on.</li>
</ol>
We have two ways how to deal with a failed message:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Remove the message</strong> from the queue either by discarding it or  by moving it to the queue's "back-out queue". This is appropriate when  the message itself is the problem (e.g. contains data inconsistent with  the DB ...).</li>
	<li><strong>Stop processing messages</strong> from the queue (pause the  Activation Specification) and restart it later when the problem is  resolved. This is appropriate when a necessary resource is temporarily  unavailable.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Messaging provider and JMS resources configuration related to error handling</h4>
We will use JCA 1.5 Activation Specification (and not <a title="Visit page outside WikiCentral" rel="nofollow" href="https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/cmb_aslp.html">Listener Ports that are deprecated<sup><img src="https://w3.tap.ibm.com/w3ki/images/icons/linkext7.gif" border="0" alt="" width="7" height="7" align="absmiddle" /></sup></a> since WAS 7) with Websphere MQ as the provider, which limits our <a href="https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/tmj_adm20.html">configuration options</a> to those described below.
<ul>
	<li>Disabling (temporarily) the whole queue, more exactly shutting down the MDB
<ul>
	<li>"Number of sequential delivery failures before suspending endpoint" - on an MQ Activation Specification</li>
	<li>"Stop endpoint if message delivery fails" - if true, message  delivery suspended when the Number of sequential delivery failures...  exceeded
<ul>
	<li>Prior to the Fix Pack 7.0.1.0 this only applies when either the  MDB throws an exception or an internal error happens, not when the  transaction is marked for rollback (Issue <a title="Visit page outside WikiCentral" rel="nofollow" href="https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&amp;uid=swg1IC60714">IC60714<sup><img src="https://w3.tap.ibm.com/w3ki/images/icons/linkext7.gif" border="0" alt="" width="7" height="7" align="absmiddle" /></sup></a>).</li>
	<li>When the endpoint is stopped, a JMX notification can be sent so  that somebody is informed that the endpoint will need to be re-enabled.  Perhaps we could automate this re-activation with a scheduled stateless  EJB using Websphere JMX to perform the reactivation after a delay.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Removing problematic messages (this is done by Websphere MQ itself, not WAS)
<ul>
	<li>"Backout threshold" (BOTHRESH; a property of a queue, configured via  MQ)  specifies the maximum number of times a message can be put onto a  queue  before it is moved to the specified backout requeue queue.   Default: 0  or unset?! =&gt; never re-delivered</li>
	<li>"Backout requeue queue" (BOQNAME; a property of a queue, configured  via MQ) - the queue where to put the failed messages; default:  SYSTEM.DEAD.LETTER.QUEUE</li>
	<li>WARNING: This seems to apply only to a queue, not to a topic. But  underneath topics use (likely dynamic) queues anyway so it should be  possible somehow.
<ul>

	<li>Other related settings
<ul>
	<li>There is <strong>no way to configure how often WAS should check for new messages</strong>, at least none I could find. There is a "<a title="Visit page outside WikiCentral" rel="nofollow" href="https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.base.iseries.doc/info/iseries/ae/umj_pasm_advprops.html">rescan interval<sup><img src="https://w3.tap.ibm.com/w3ki/images/icons/linkext7.gif" border="0" alt="" width="7" height="7" align="absmiddle" /></sup></a>"  that tells WAS how long to wait before checking another queue but seems  only to apply when there are more queues than scanning threads. The  default value is 5s and according to some posts it can't be increased  (though this might not be true anymore in our version/fixpack level).</li>

</ul>
<h3>Design of the MDB approach</h3>
<h4>Error handling design</h4>
The main problem with the MDB approach is that it doesn't support  retrying an operation after a delay (either for a single failing message  or for the whole queue, if a resource is temporarily unavailable). There  are some workarounds, but not very nice.
<ul>
	<li>For a single message I couldn't find a way to implement retrials  after some, preferably increasing, delay; the only thing we can do is to  retry it few times with the default Websphere's delay, which seems to be  5s, and if it still doesn't succeed then move it into a special queue that  would be processed manually while perhaps also sending an email  notification.</li>
	<li>If there is some global problem, such as an unavailable resource,  indicated by several consecutive failures of one or more messages  (depending on the content of the queue), we could let WAS stop the MDB  and re-enable it later either automatically after a delay or manually  when the problem gets fixed.</li>
</ul>
<h4>MDB design</h4>
<ul>
	<li>When resource unavailability is detected, let WAS stop the MDB automatically  via the setting "Number of sequential delivery failures before  suspending endpoint". It will need to be re-enabled either manually or  automatically.
<ul>
	<li>Manual re-activation of the MDB: We have to somehow detect that  the MDB was disabled (the only option is perhaps by watching the log),  find out why it failed, and re-enable it via the Websphere Administration  Console.</li>
	<li>Automated re-activation: Implement a scheduled stateless EJB,  which re-enables the MDB after few tens of minutes - preferably do this  few times with increasing delay, if still failing, give up and notify an  admin.
<ul>
	<li>To find out when reactivation is necessary, the re-activating EJB  can either regularly check the status of the MDB (which is feasible) or listen for JMX notifications issued by the logging system and  <a title="Visit page outside WikiCentral" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/forums/thread.jspa?messageID=14489302">watch for a deactivation<sup><img src="https://w3.tap.ibm.com/w3ki/images/icons/linkext7.gif" border="0" alt="" width="7" height="7" align="absmiddle" /></sup></a> notification. (The log watching approach isn't very elegant, the EJB  would receive many unrelated notification, which is an unnecessary work  for the server. Unfortunately the endpoint doesn't produce any special  JMX notification, just a log record.)</li>
	<li>The re-activation itself is performed via JMX by invoking resume() on the appropriate <a href="https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.javadoc.doc/web/mbeanDocs/J2CMessageEndpoint.html">J2CMessageEndpoint MBean</a> (see the link above for how to get a handle to it).</li>
	<li>In any case the application would need the permission to perform  some WAS administration operations, namely to re-activate the MDB,  and perhaps also to access JMX or the AdminServiceFactory/AdminService,  which might be a problem if corporate security rules do not allow that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>When there is a poison message, move it to the backout queue and  notify somebody to handle it (e.g. via email)
<ul>
	<li>If the queue contains only one message there is no generic way how  to find out whether the problem is within the message or in some  resource, the MDB would need to find this out and communicate it. If there are multiple messages and only one fails, we know it's a poison message and it could be automatically removed by means of the "Backout threshold". (Beware of the interaction  between the message's redelivery count/backout threashold and the   "Number of sequential delivery failures..." - the letter is reset when  either a message processing succeeds or when the MDB is  stopped/restarted.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>(Perhaps we could use JMS <a title="Visit page outside WikiCentral" rel="nofollow" href="https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv6/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.csqzaw.doc/uj25420_.htm">selectors<sup><img src="https://w3.tap.ibm.com/w3ki/images/icons/linkext7.gif" border="0" alt="" width="7" height="7" align="absmiddle" /></sup></a> on <a title="Visit page outside WikiCentral" rel="nofollow" href="https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv6/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.csqzaw.doc/uj25450_.htm">JMS header properties<sup><img src="https://w3.tap.ibm.com/w3ki/images/icons/linkext7.gif" border="0" alt="" width="7" height="7" align="absmiddle" /></sup></a> (e.g. JMSRedeliveredto, JMSXDeliveryCount) but the possibilities are  rather limited because both the selector query and the properties are  static (e.g. something like MyRetryTime &gt;= now() isn't possible).  Note: MQ V7 has a major <a title="Visit page outside WikiCentral" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.mqseries.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=44609">rewrite of the selectors<sup><img src="https://w3.tap.ibm.com/w3ki/images/icons/linkext7.gif" border="0" alt="" width="7" height="7" align="absmiddle" /></sup></a> support and their handling was moved from the Java client directly to the queue manager.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>MDB approach evaluation</h3>
<h4>Key MDB issues</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Permissions to perform a WAS administration operation required.</li>
	<li>Difficult to distinguish a poison message from a resource outage without additional logic when the queue contains only one element.
<ul>
	<li>But see the batch job design below, which also requires to be able to distinguish these two types of problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Inefficient determination of MDB's status for the delay reactivation  logic: either polling its status regularly or watching the log with  many unrelated messages that can't be filtered out.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Key MDB advantages and disadvantages</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Advantages
<ul>
	<li>The data is processed and reaches the destination system soon after it is published</li>
	<li>Key characteristics are configurable via UI (Number of sequential  delivery failures, Backout threshold, MQ connection data, MQ  security/SSL, processing concurrency, DataSource  configuration/injection, ...). Actually this is also a disadvantage due  to needing an admin, see below</li>
	<li>Logging configurable at the runtime (Java logging, levels can be set in WAS console)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Disadvantages
<ul>
	<li>Any configuration requires a WAS administrator and thus lot of time due to the IBM bureaucracy and ceremony</li>
	<li>Difficult to collect and communicate statistics for our Operations  Dashboard because (a) there are frequent fine-grained changes instead  of 1/day batch changes and (b) there is no support for the Job logging  framework of ours (a possible but laborious solution is to gather statistics in  an instance variable and log them in regular intervals into the job  tables using JDBC and some code extracted from the job framework)</li>
	<li>Necessary to somehow configure the reactivation EJB (the reactivation delay, number of attempts before giving up)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>MDB design questions:</strong>
<ul>
	<li> Do we need automated reactivation of a disabled MDB? Perhaps not  if: (1) a resource outage happens rarely and/or (2) the administration  team spots this automatically and can handle it automatically without  any bureaucracy and consumption of our resources.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Approach 2: A batch job checking MQ regularly</h2>
A batch job is a command-line application that is regularly, for example once a day, run by cron and actively scans its incoming queue/topic for new messages and processes them all at once. All the JMS communication and management and configuration must be implemented from scratch. (Though utilities such as <a href="https://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/api/org/springframework/jms/core/JmsTemplate.html">Spring JMS template</a> may simplify it.)
<h3>Job error handling and configuration</h3>
<h4>Error handling<strong> </strong></h4>
The problems and ways to deal with errors are the same as when running in an application server, only we have to do everything ourselves. That means we need to manually start a transaction, catch exception and commit/roll back and configure the topic/queue for poison messages.<br><br>We would need to implement a problem cause detection logic to distinguish whether  there is a temporary resource outage or whether there is a problem with  the message itself (either incorrect data type or data inconsistent with the target DB ). There is no other good way to deal with these distinct kinds of  problems without really knowing which of them it is.<br><br>We would deal with the problems as follows:
<ul>
	<li>For a resource outage, retry few times with an increasing delay, then quit and postpone the processing till the next scheduled execution</li>
	<li>For a poison message, move it to the backout queue and notify an administrator</li>
</ul>
<h4>JMS configuration in a batch job</h4>
We have two ways to configure the JMS resources (a Topic and a (Topic)ConnectionFactory) and their options related to error handling:
<ol>
	<li>Use MQ provider-specific APIs to create the objects and configure them. See this <a href="https://hursleyonwmq.wordpress.com/2007/05/29/simplest-sample-applications-using-websphere-mq-jms/">JMS + MQ API example</a>.</li>
	<li>Configure the provider-specific resources in JNDI and use only the standardized JNDI and JMS APIs. This is very easy with Sun's <a href="https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iseries/v5r3/index.jsp?topic=/rzaha/dasrjndi.htm">filesystem-based JNDI provider</a> (<a href="https://java.sun.com/products/jndi/downloads/index.html">fscontext.jar and providerutil.jar</a>) and vendor-supplied tools for generating the JNDI .bindings file for existing JMS resources . In the case of MQ you can <a href="https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.mq.csqzaw.doc/jm35200_.htm">do it in the MQ Explorer</a> GUI or with the command-line utility JMSAdmin (a <a href="https://blog.testsautomation.com/2009/02/ibm-websphere-mq-testing-using-loadrunner/">JMSAdmin example</a>, <a href="https://drugsearch.eof.gr/jms/queue/simple/docs/3_ConfigMQSeries.html">another one</a>).</li>
</ol>
You can create the JNDI configuration via the MQ Explorer wizards - after having added a new JNDI "context" using fscontext and a local directory - either by first creating the JMS resource and then letting the wizard generate an MQ resources for it and adjusting it as needed:<br><br><img class="alignnone" title="MQ Explorer: Create a new JMS Destination" src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/_btcPMCQkYvg/TI3xeIEBRTI/AAAAAAAABZc/BC-omVRZ-GM/s800/MQ_EXplorer-new_jndi_destination.PNG" alt="" width="553" height="344" /><br><br>Or by creating the JMS resource from an existing MQ resource:<br><br><img class="alignnone" title="MQ Explorer: Create a JMS Topic from an existing MQ Topic" src="https://lh4.ggpht.com/_btcPMCQkYvg/TI3xeQg93OI/AAAAAAAABZk/0hmV5jkhonE/s800/MQ_EXplorer-create_jms_topic_from_topic.PNG" alt="" width="519" height="314" /><br><br>Provided that the FsContext configuration file .bindings produced by JMSAdmin/MQ Explorer is in the folder /etc/mqJndiconfig, we would connect to the MQ as follows:<br><br><pre><code>
final Hashtable&lt;String, String&gt; env = new Hashtable&lt;String, String&gt;();
env.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, &quot;com.sun.jndi.fscontext.RefFSContextFactory&quot;);
env.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, &quot;file:/etc/mqJndiconfig&quot;);<br><br>final InitialContext context = new InitialContext(env);
ConnectionFactory qcf = (javax.jms.ConnectionFactory) context.lookup(&quot;MyConnectionFactory&quot;);
 // Note: I set the channel property MCAUSER so it actually isn't necessary to supply credentials below:
final Connection connection = qcf.createConnection(&quot;anna&quot;, &quot;password ignored&quot;);<br><br>// Client ID is necessary for a durable subscr.
// We could alternatively set in on the ConnectionFactory - the CLIENTID  property
connection.setClientID(&quot;MyCoolApplication&quot;);<br><br>final Session session = connection.createSession(true, -1); // the param 2 is ignored for durable subscr.<br><br>final Topic destination = (Topic) context.lookup(JNDI_PREFIX + TOPIC);
final MessageConsumer receiver = subscribe(session, destination);<br><br>try {
	connection.start();
} catch (javax.jms.JMSException e) {
	throw new RuntimeException(&quot;Failed to start the JMS connection&quot;, e);
}
</code></pre><br><br>We would then read the messages via:<br><br><pre><code>
while ((msg= receiver.receiveNoWait()) != null) {
			handleMessage(msg);
}
</code></pre><br><br>The dependencies include <a href="https://java.sun.com/products/jms/docs.html">jms.jar</a>, fscontext.jar and providerutil.jar. You can find them either <a href="https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv6/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.csqzaw.doc/uj10310_.htm">in the WMQ installation</a> or on the web.<br><br>You may want to have a look at <a href="https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv6/v6r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.mq.csqzaw.doc/uj24660_.htm">Writing a simple publish/subscribe application connecting through WebSphere MQ</a> in WMQ help, which discusses some of the code above in more detail.
<h3>Job design</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Set a reasonable backout threshold and a suitable backout queue on the queue used by the Topic so that <strong>problematic messages are removed automatically</strong> after few failed attempts
<ul>
	<li>Some monitoring of the backout queue would be necessary. If the MQ  infrastructure doesn't provide it then we can implement another MQ/JMS  reader that would send an email when there are some new messages in the  queue.</li>
	<li>Regarding the type of the topic queue:
<ul>
	<li>Either we can use the shared JMS queue (SYSTEM.JMS.D.SUBSCRIBER.QUEUE) for the topic</li>
	<li>Or we can use a non-shared queue unique for our application,  which would be actually better and more aligned with IBM standards. It's  achieved by setting a broker durable subscription queue pattern in the  form "SYSTEM.JMS.D..*" (notice the trailing *) on the JMS ConnectionFactory when  defining it in JNDI or in the Java code. Upon the first  connection a permanent dynamic queue is generated for the client. We can  then set the backout options on it (or the administrators may define a  model queue for these dynamic queues with this setting already applied).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Read and <strong>process each message in a new MQ transaction</strong> so  that if the processing fails it will be put back into the queue (and its  delivery count will be increased, thus making it perhaps eligible for  the backout queue)
<ul>
	<li>ISSUE: The <strong>failed message would be obtained again on the next read</strong> (because it goes to the front, not to the end of the subscriber's  queue) and thus we can't process any other message before dealing with  it. Possible solutions:
<ol>
	<li>Fail immediately, try again during the next regular run. If this  happens several times in a row for a particular message then it will be  moved to the backout queue by MQ (w.r.t. the settings above).</li>
	<li>Wait for a while such as 10-20m and try it again. If it still fails, continue as in #1.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Notice that <strong>DB transactions are not a part of the MQ transaction</strong> (unless we use some external transaction manager and XA resource  managers, which would require more work) but that shouldn't be a problem  for us. If the DB tx fails then we will manually roll back the MQ tx.  If the DB tx succeeds but later we fail to communicate the success to MQ  then the message will stay in the queue and be processed again, which  isn't a big problem in our particular case. (<ins>Global transactions</ins> with DB operations being a part of the MQ tx are supported only either <a title="Visit page outside WikiCentral" rel="nofollow" href="https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv6/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.amqzag.doc/fa13470_.htm">(1) for a "server application"<sup><img src="https://w3.tap.ibm.com/w3ki/images/icons/linkext7.gif" border="0" alt="" width="7" height="7" align="absmiddle" /></sup></a> running on the MQ machine or <a href="https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv6/v6r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.mq.csqzaf.doc/cs10270_.htm">(2) with an external XA tx manager</a>, such as in WAS.)</li>

<h3>Batch job approach evaluation</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Advantages
<ul>
	<li><strong>Simple implementation of</strong> <strong>flexible</strong> <strong>delayed retrials</strong> - upon a resource outage, end the job and try again during the next  scheduled run or, perhaps, retry first after a manual delay  (Thread.sleep(); beware connection timeouts).</li>
	<li><strong>Simple integration into our monitoring</strong>/logging framework incl. the Operations Dashboard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Disadvantages
<ul>
	<li><strong>More coding</strong> to set up/clean the resources and handle errors, which is not trivial, and thus also <strong>more bug prone</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Concurrent processing</strong> of the messages would be considerably <strong>more difficult</strong> to implement correctly if possible at all (if MQ JMS does implement the  necessary optional methods). We would need to use the advanced methods  targeted at app. server vendors - there is a non-MQ example of a <a title="Visit page outside WikiCentral" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.novell.com/documentation/extend52/Docs/help/MP/jms/tutorial/connConsumer-1.htm">multithreaded (non-durable subscription) consumer<sup><img src="https://w3.tap.ibm.com/w3ki/images/icons/linkext7.gif" border="0" alt="" width="7" height="7" align="absmiddle" /></sup></a>. Hopefully it could be modified for a durable one using <a title="Visit page outside WikiCentral" rel="nofollow" href="https://bit.ly/d1iucS">Connection.createDurableConnectionConsumer<sup><img src="https://w3.tap.ibm.com/w3ki/images/icons/linkext7.gif" border="0" alt="" width="7" height="7" align="absmiddle" /></sup></a> with the same simple implementation of ServerSessionPool.
<ul>
	<li>Impl. details: The "pool" would always create a new custom  ServerSession implementation. instance, whose getSession() would simply  create a new transacted TopicSession, set its MessageListener, and run  the session in a new Thread when start() called. Notice that  (Topic)Session implements Runnable, whose run() invokes the provided  listener sequentially for available messages. The listener would process a  message and call commit/rollback on its owning session (see this <a title="Visit page outside WikiCentral" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.magpiebrain.com/2005/04/04/jms-transactions-and-exception-handling/">transactional listener example<sup><img src="https://w3.tap.ibm.com/w3ki/images/icons/linkext7.gif" border="0" alt="" width="7" height="7" align="absmiddle" /></sup></a>).</li>
	<li>Important: <strong>Handling of failed messages</strong> would need to be  considered carefully as returning a message to the queue would lead to  its immediate re-processing and likely rejection by one of the other  threads, exceeding its backout treshold in a few seconds and thus  subverting the delayed retrial processing. On the other hand, as  mentioned above, we should anyway be able to distinguish resource  outage, in which case we would stop processing immediately, and a  problematic message, which would anyway end up in the backout queue so  this is perhaps not a real issue.</li>
	<li>Note: When using MessageListeners, it's important to set an  ExceptionListener on the connection because some errors can only be  communicated this way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Summary and conclusion</h1>
The version and fixpack level of WMQ/WAS is very important.<br><br>﻿Both the approaches have some pros and cons and it depends on the requirements and their priority which one would be more suitable.<br><br>MDB: ﻿It's more difficult to implement delayed retrial if it is required - it may be implemented via a scheduled EJB automatically re-enabling the MDB stopped by WAS after a number of failures (one issue is that we'd need WAS admin rights for the EJB to do that; another is performance due to the need to either monitor logs or check the MDB's status regularly). On the other hand, concurrent processing is available out of the box and also implementing a bean notifying about problematic messages in the backout queue is simpler thanks to the injection of the mail API resources. This solution may thus require some JMX and Java EE (scheduled EJB) magic and there may be unexpected problems with that.<br><br>﻿JOB: Concurrency: it's more difficult to implement processing of the messages in parallel, there is even a slight chance that it's impossible. Also  more coding is required and thus there will be more bugs. On the other hand we can implement delayed retrials as we want. Thus if concurrent processing isn't critical while the automatic delayed retrial may be then this would be the best approach.
