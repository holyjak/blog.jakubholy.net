Subversion is at times really annoying and difficult to use due to its cryptic and confusing error messages and unnecessary failures. An example is when you have an svn-managed folder ('svnProject') where svn -u status and svn info and even commiting individual files work correctly but commit of the complete folder (which is necessary e.g. if you've changes some SVN proprties such as svn:ignore) fails:<br><br><pre><code>
.../rootFolder/svnProject$ svn commit .
svn: '/path/to/my/rootFolder' has no ancestry information
</code></pre><br><br>There is an easy fix.
<!--more-->Notice that the error is reported for the parent folder of the svn-managed one (from) which we've tried to commit. It actually seems that SVN checks the folder structure and <a href="https://victorhurdugaci.com/svn-no-ancestry-information/">fails if some parts of the folder tree above the folder being commited have svn metadata and some do not</a> (<a href="https://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2007-04/0039.shtml">another example</a>):
<ul>
	<li>/path/to/my - has .svn/ folder (a totaly unrelated one, a left-over from the old times)
<ul>
	<li>rootFolder - no .svn here
<ul>
	<li>svnProject - has a valid .svn/ metadata folder, this is the project/folder we're trying to commit</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>Verification</strong>: You can verify that by moving the folder that you are trying to commit to some other location (e.g. /tmp or even /) and retrying to commit it from there. If it succeeds then you've encountered this problem. If not then you have likely some other issue.<br><br><strong>Solution</strong>: Check the ancestor folders (especially above the one reported in the commit failure message) and if you find an .svn/ folder in any of them, as I suppose, remove it. Alternatively, move the folder of interest into another location where it has no ancestor folder with .svn/ within it.<br><br>Environment: SVN 1.4.6, on Ubuntu 10.04.
