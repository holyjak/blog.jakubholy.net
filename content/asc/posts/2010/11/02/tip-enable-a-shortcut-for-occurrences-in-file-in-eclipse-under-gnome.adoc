The useful Eclipse action <strong>Search - Occurrences in File - Identifier</strong> has by default the shortcut Control+Shift+U. But under Gnome the shortcut <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ComposeKey#Unicode%20composition">Control+Shift+U is used for Unicode character input</a>, indicated by an underlined <span style="text-decoration:underline;">u</span> when pressed. Assigning a different shortcut is easy but there are few "traps":
<ol>
	<li>In Eclipse, go to Window - Preferences - General - Keys</li>
	<li>Type  the filter <em>occurr</em> and click on "<em>Shows the Occurrences in File Quick  Menu</em>". Do not confuse it with "Occurences in File" (binding C+S+A, when  Editing in Structured T. Ed.)!
<ol>
	<li>Make sure that When is "<em>In Windows</em>", Category is "<em>Search</em>"</li>
	<li>Click [Unbind Command], click into the Binding field and type the keys  that you want. Beware that some keys could conflict with existing bindings  or global Gnome/system bindings. For me e.g. Control+Shift+S or F8 worked (though I might have to unbind conflicting bindings, I don't remember anymore).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
Environment: Eclipse 3.5, Gnome 2.30.2, Ubuntu 10.04.
