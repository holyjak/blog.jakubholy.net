If you would like to get the security <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate">certificate</a> used by a server in communication over SSL, such as with the HTTPS or POP3s protocols, for instance to install it on a client device that needs to talk to the server, you can use <a href="https://openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a> to retrieve it:<br><br><pre><code><br><br>bash$ openssl s_client -connect pop.gmail.com:995 -showcerts<br><br></code></pre><br><br>You then store the text starting with "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" and ending with "-----END CERTIFICATE-----" (inclusive) into a file with the extension .pem.<br><br>You can also use openssl to convert the certificate into another format, e.g.:<br><br><pre><code><br><br>bash$ openssl x509 -in mycertificate.pem -inform PEM -out mycertificate.der -outform DER<br><br></code></pre><br><br>The information originates from the page <a href="https://www.axllent.org/docs/networking/gmail_pop3_with_fetchmail">Gmail POP3 with Fetchmail</a> where you can find a more detailed description and also instructions for testing the certificate.
