<h1>Released DbUnit Test Skeleton 1.1.0 - also in Maven Central</h1><br />I've released version 1.1.0 of my DbUnit extension, which is now also available in the Maven central repository under the group id net.jakubholy.testing and artifact id dbunit-embeddedderby-parenttest. It brings some API changes, new utillities and removes the need to extend the base TestCase class.<br /><h3>What is it?</h3>Creating a a <a title="http://www.dbunit.org/" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dbunit.org/" class="external text">DbUnit</a> test case may be time consuming. With the dbunit-embeddedderby-parenttest you can have your DbUnit test including an embedded database with structures and data ready in a few minutes. (At least if you are fast enough in writing SQL and preparing your data :-) ).<br /><br />The added value of this project is that provides classes pre-configured to interact with an embedded Derby database and the only thing you need to do is to provide a DDL file, execute a utillity to create the database, and enter data into the predefined data set XML file. In addition to that it also provides some nice utility methods and classes such as <a title="http://jeeutils.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/jeeutils/trunk/DbUnitTestSkeleton/src/main/java/net/jakubholy/testing/dbunit/embeddeddb/assertion/RowComparator.java?view=markup" rel="nofollow" href="https://jeeutils.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/jeeutils/trunk/DbUnitTestSkeleton/src/main/java/net/jakubholy/testing/dbunit/embeddeddb/assertion/RowComparator.java?view=markup" class="external text">RowComparator</a> and <a title="http://jeeutils.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/jeeutils/trunk/DbUnitTestSkeleton/src/main/java/net/jakubholy/testing/dbunit/embeddeddb/IEnhancedDatabaseTester.java?view=markup" rel="nofollow" href="https://jeeutils.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/jeeutils/trunk/DbUnitTestSkeleton/src/main/java/net/jakubholy/testing/dbunit/embeddeddb/IEnhancedDatabaseTester.java?view=markup" class="external text">IEnhancedDatabaseTester</a> and it overrides the default DbUnit setting to use fully qualified table names (in the form schema.table), which gives you more freedom.<br /><h3>New and noteworthy</h3>As you can guess from the version number change, the API has changed and may be not compatible with some code written against a previous version. The main changes are:<br /><ul><li>All functionality moved to EmbeddedDbTester so that extending the AbstractEmbeddedDbTestCase isn't necessary anymore, which is useful e.g. in JUnit 4 or when extending another JUnit derivation. It's also a standard DbUnit's IDatabaseTester.</li><li>It's now possible to change completely the DB used by defining some JDBC properties in dbunit-embedded.properties</li><li>Added utility methods getDataSource, getSqlConnection and a convenience method createCheckerForSelect, some of those implemented in  the EnhancedDatabaseTesterDecorator so that they can be added to any IDatabaseTester.</li><li>Switched from Java util logging to commons-logging for better configurability.<br /><br />You can download the release also from the Maven Central Repository at <a title="http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/jakubholy/testing/dbunit-embeddedderby-parenttest/1.1.0/" id="xsov" href="https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/jakubholy/testing/dbunit-embeddedderby-parenttest/1.1.0/">http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/jakubholy/testing/dbunit-embeddedderby-parenttest/1.1.0/</a><br /></li></ul><br />
