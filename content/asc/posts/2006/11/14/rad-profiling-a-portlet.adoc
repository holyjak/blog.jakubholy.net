Recently I needed to profile a portlet to find its time performance bottlenecks. Since I developed it in RAD using its WebSphere 5.1 Test Environment, I thought I'd run the server in the Profiling mode and would get the results. The profiler worked very hard, but at the end no results were displayed.&nbsp; I tried to profile a simple (non server) Java app. - again it seemed to do something but no results vere displayed. But finally I've found how to get the data using hprof:<br />
<h5>Analyzing portlet performance with hprof</h5>
<ol>
<li>Create a normal Java app. that will call the portlet's code or a JUnit (or e.g. MockObjectTestCase, if you need&nbsp; JNDI and the like set up) test</li>
<li>Write a <span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, mono;">main </span>method of the app. and call there the portlet code. If it's a test case, don't forget to call setUp before and tearDown after that.</li>
<li>At the end of main call <span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, mono;">System.exit(0)</span> - otherwise it may happen that the thread will not actually finish and thus the output won't be completely generated (usually there will only be a header and names of threads that have started). Killing it via the red square button stops the threads but doesn't generate the output.</li>
<li>Run the app./test case as a "Java Application" using a Sun JRE 1.4 (IBM JRE would fail) and passing the VM the option "<span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, mono;">-Xrunhprof:cpu=samples,thread=y,file=cpu_profiling.hprof,depth=32</span>"</li></ol>The important points: Call System.exit at the end and use Sun's JRE 1.4.<br />
<h5>Analyzing the output of hprof<br /></h5>The best is to find a tool that analyzis the output of hprof. If you want to do it yourself, look first at the end of the file - there is a list of the most time consuming methods, each with a trace number. Find a stack trace of the method in the previous part of the file using that number. Note that the stack traces are not ordered w.r.t. the trace number.<br />
<h5>Additional notes</h5>I've also tried Eclipse 3.2 and its profiling tool (TPTP). For a simple java application it displayed no output untill I changed the default options, setting polling frequency to 1sec (default: auto). I had also some problems trying to run it with JRE 5.0 but 1.4 was ok. So perhaps the RAD's profiling would display soem results if set correctly.<br /><br />
