{:title "Consciousness sabbatical for the forseeable future"
 :date "2025-09-07"}

Technology is fun, but there are far more important things in life. Such as understanding what life, self, and everything really is. It has been really quiet here this year, and it will continue to be that way because to progress I need to focus. I may come back or I may not. It doesn't really matter either way :-).

If you don't really know what consciousness is or why it should matter, I cannot recommend enough as a starting point the book https://chenghsin.com/ending-unnecessary-suffering/[Ending Unnecessary Suffering]. And even more than the book, the corresponding workshop, which makes it far easier to actually experience the stuff (and, hopefully, a fundamental perspective shift), rather than just thinking about it. Thinking is pointless (it is, after all, what gets us in all this mess), getting insights in one's own experience is what makes a difference.
All the best, and thank you for all the fish*!
