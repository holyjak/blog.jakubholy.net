A brief overview of dependency injection in Java EE, the difference between @Resource/@EJB and @Inject, and how does that all relate to Spring - mostly in the form of links.<br><br><em>Context Dependency Injection</em> (CDI, <a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299">JSR 299</a>) is a part of Java EE 6 Web Profile and itself builds on <em>Dependency Injection for Java</em> (<a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=330">JSR 330</a>), which introduces @Inject, @Named etc. While JSR 330 is for DI only and is implemented e.g. by Guice and Spring, CDI adds various EE stuff such as @RequestScoped, interceptors/decorators, producers, eventing and a base for integration with JSF, EJBs etc. Java EE components such as EJBs have been redefined to build on top of CDI (=&gt; @Stateless is now a CDI managed bean with additional services).<br><br>A key part of CDI aside of its DI capabilities is its awarness of bean contexts and the management of bean lifecycle and dependencies within those contexts (such as @RequestScoped or @ConversationScoped).<br><br>CDI is extensible - you can define new context scopes, drop-in interceptors and decorators, make other beans (e.g. from Spring) available for CDI,... .<br><br>Resources to check:<!--more-->

	<li>Guice and Spring do not implement CDI (3/2011) - and Spring <a href="//stackoverflow.com/questions/7238407/will-spring-support-cdi">perhaps isn't motivated to do so</a> (it supports JSR 330, CDI would be too much work)</li>

Note: CDI 1.1 (<a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=346">JSR 346</a>, Java EE 7) should have a standard way of bootstrapping it in non-EE environment (i.e. SE)
