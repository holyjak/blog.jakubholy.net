Sometimes you really need java 1.4, mainly because just compiling with -target doesn't protect you from inadverently using an API that only exists in 1.5+.<br><br>Fortunately, <a href="https://jevopisdeveloperblog.blogspot.com/2010/06/install-strictly-j2se-14-compatible-jre.html">Jens v. P. has described how to install Java 1.4 on Mac OS X</a> without destroying your current (latest) java installation - download Java_for_Mac_OS_X_10_5_Update_4 from Apple and use Pacifist to install only System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.4.2 and 1.4. Thanks, Jens!
