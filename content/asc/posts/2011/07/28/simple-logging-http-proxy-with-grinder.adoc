Sometimes I need to observe HTTP communication between my and another machine. I usually use Eclipse' integrated TCP/IP monitor for it's simple and does its job well but today for a large response it just displayed "The HTTP content is too large to display." so I started searching for alternatives and found the <a href="https://grinder.sourceforge.net/g3/tcpproxy.html">Grinder TCPProxy</a>, written in Java and distributed under the BSD license.<br><br><a href="https://grinder.sourceforge.net/">Grinder</a> is a Java load testing framework and the proxy is just a part of it. Here is how you would start the proxy to forward local port 6080 to the remote address example.webservices.com:80 and log the HTTP communication into a file:<br><br><pre><code>java -cp lib/grinder.jar net.grinder.TCPProxy -console -localhost 127.0.0.1  -localport 6080 -remotehost example.webservices.com -remoteport 80 &gt; http.log</code></pre><br><br>The optional flag <code>-console</code> makes it  to display a window for shutting it down cleanly (likely unnecessary under Linux/Mac). When you want it to log just into the console, add <code>-colour</code> for nicely colored output.<br><br>Run it with <code>-?</code> to see all the available options.
