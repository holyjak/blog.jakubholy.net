== What is happening

Not much is happening, since August has been a vacation month. When there was time, I worked on wrapping up https://github.com/scicloj/wolframite[Wolframite] and its documentation.

<p><span class="link">ðŸ‘“ <a href="https://github.com/potetm/fusebox">potetm/fusebox: An extremely lightweight fault tolerance library for Clojure</a> [library, clojure, devops]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">An extremely lightweight fault tolerance library for Clojure. Provides Bulkhead, Circuit Breaker, Fallback, Memoize, Rate Limit, Retry, Timeout, Register, Bulwark. It aims at being simple, favoring functions over options and callbacks.</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Noteworthy: "These utilities are identical to Resilience4J at their core, but thanks to immutable data, namespaced keys, and a dash of macros, Clojure affords us <em>much</em> simpler implementations."</span></p><p><span class="link">ðŸ‘“ <a href="https://grishaev.me/en/clojure-with-retry/">Clojure AntiPatterns: the with-retry macro</a> [opinion]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">In short, think really hard whether retrying a failed operation makes sense, and beware the negative side-effects (longer timeouts, flood of logs, compounding retries, ...). Especially do not retry on errors where retry cannot help (404, bad credentials, ...). Valuable lessons there! </span></p><p><span class="link">ðŸ‘“ <a href="https://explain.dalibo.com/">explain.dalibo.com</a> [tool, database, performance]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">A little buggy but still extremely useful visualizer of PostgreSQL explain data. My dear colleague Jo has used it to troubleshoot a query that he managed to bring down from 4 min to few seconds. (The trick was replacing in with unnest - it seems to create an in-memory table, which is much efficient to search, then the flat list of IN.)</span></p>
