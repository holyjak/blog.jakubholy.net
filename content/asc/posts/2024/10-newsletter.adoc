== What is happening

I have taken a break from coding and spent instead time reading, meditating, and exercising üí™, so there is a lot of "gems" this month. Though some coding, was there - I have helped Tony kick-start a rewrite of Fulcro Inspect to support the new Chrome manifest and thus not be removed from Chrome Web Store (while Tony has also taken the opportunity to also move it from Fulcro 2 to three). You can https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-inspect/tree/manifest-upgrade-jakub?tab=readme-ov-file#building-chrome-extension[help us out and try it out]. I have also extended my https://github.com/holyjak/clj-tumblr-summarizer[clj-tumblr-summarizer], which creates the gems summary below, to support overriding a single updated post.

Another update is that Heart of Clojure talks have been released, and I have added links to my favourite ones to the https://xref:09-newsletter.adoc[September newsletter].

"Clojure‚Äôs principles are just sound ideas that really do make a huge impact on simplifying software development."</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Rama contains a new programming language implementing a new programming paradigm (functions, or rather "fragments", form a reactive tree, and can emit 0, 1, or many times; built-in distributed programming). All this is written primarily in Clojure macros, and then Rama itself.</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">"These philosophies [data-oriented programming, immutability] have had a major impact on Rama‚Äôs development, helping a tremendous amount in managing complexity within Rama‚Äôs implementation." </span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">If you are new to Rama, then quote is rather interesting:</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;"><div class="indented" style="padding-left: 1em">Rama‚Äôs language extends Clojure‚Äôs immutable principles into writing distributed, fault-tolerant, and async code. There‚Äôs a lot of similarities with Clojure like anonymous operations with lexical closures, immutable local variables, and identical semantics when it comes to shadowing. Rama takes things a step further for distributed computation, doing things like scope analysis to determine what vars needs to be transferred across network boundaries. Rama‚Äôs loops have similar syntax to Clojure and have the additional capability of being able to be a distributed computation that hops around the cluster during loop iterations. With Rama this is all written linearly through the power of dataflow, with switching threads/nodes being an operation like anything else (called a ‚Äúpartitioner‚Äù).</div></span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Nathan asks a good question: "if Clojure enables such productivity gains, then why is it still a niche language in the industry?" and answers: "I believe this is simply because Clojure does not address all aspects of software development. [...] Things like durable data storage, deployment, monitoring, evolving an application‚Äôs state and logic over time, fault-tolerance, and scaling are huge costs of building end-to-end software. Oftentimes the principles of Clojure are corrupted when using a database,..."</span></p><p><span class="link">üëì <a href="https://blog.redplanetlabs.com/2024/09/30/migrating-terabytes-of-data-instantly-can-your-alter-table-do-this/">Migrating terabytes of data instantly (can your ALTER TABLE do this?)</a> [rama, database]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Nathan points out that non-trivial schema migrations in most databases are at best complicated, at worst impossible, and introduces Rama's new, transparent migration support. You write the migration with full power of Rama, and it seems instantaneous (while, under the hood, Rama automatically migrates data on read, while it is running the migration on the persisted data in the background).</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">What is the problem with e.g. SQL migrations? You need to use SQL, possibly duplicating your business logic, you risk locking the whole table, you need to sync code deployment and make it work with both previous and new schema, while the migration is running.</span></p><p><span class="link">üëì <a href="https://github.com/electric-sql/pglite">electric-sql/pglite: Lightweight WASM Postgres with real-time, reactive bindings.</a> [wasm, database]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">PGlite is a WASM Postgres build packaged into a TypeScript client library that enables you to run Postgres in the browser, Node.js, Bun and Deno, with no need to install any other dependencies. It is only 3mb gzipped and has support for many Postgres extensions... </span></p><p><span class="link">üëì <a href="https://github.com/xadecimal/expose-api">xadecimal/expose-api: A Clojure library to automatically generate public API namespaces by wrapping and exposing...</a> [clojure, library]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Library for library builders - create a ns with your public API off other namespaces. Contrary to Potemkin, this is done at build time and thus static code analysis friendly (think Cursive, clj-kondo).</span></p><p><span class="link">üëì <a href="https://github.com/anteoas/broch">anteoas/broch: A library for handling numbers with units.</a> [clojure, library]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Brochs combines¬†<strong>numbers</strong>¬†with¬†<strong>units</strong>¬†into a¬†<strong>quantity</strong>, and provide tools for working with these.

What can it do? A lot!</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Cloogle can find specific implementations:</span><ul><li><a href="https://cloogle.phronemophobic.com/doc-search.html?q=calculate+sha256+hash">https://cloogle.phronemophobic.com/doc-search.html?q=calculate+sha256+hash</a></li><li><a href="https://cloogle.phronemophobic.com/doc-search.html?q=create+and+return+a+temporary+file">https://cloogle.phronemophobic.com/doc-search.html?q=create+and+return+a+temporary+file</a></li></ul><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Cloogle uses fuzzy search which is also suitable for exploration or research:</span><ul><li><a href="https://cloogle.phronemophobic.com/doc-search.html?q=error+handler+with+exponential+backoff">https://cloogle.phronemophobic.com/doc-search.html?q=error+handler+with+exponential+backoff</a></li><li><a href="https://cloogle.phronemophobic.com/doc-search.html?q=cancel+tasks+or+processes">https://cloogle.phronemophobic.com/doc-search.html?q=cancel+tasks+or+processes</a></li></ul></p><p><span class="link">üëì <a href="https://github.com/jeans11/demo-rama-electric">jeans11/demo-rama-electric: Demo of web application with Rama and Electric</a> [learning, rama, clojure]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">As it says on the tin: a demo of <a href="https://github.com/jeans11/demo-rama-electric/blob/main/bases/server/src/dre/server/rama.clj">using Rama</a> with a couple of modules (<a href="https://github.com/jeans11/demo-rama-electric/blob/main/components/session/src/dre/session/core.clj#L69">such as Session</a>) for the backend together with Electric Clojure, <a href="https://github.com/jeans11/demo-rama-electric/blob/main/bases/server/src/dre/server/impl.clj#L73-L85">handling the BE<>FE network</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jeans11/demo-rama-electric/blob/main/bases/web-ui/src/dre/web_ui/views/board.cljc#L36">the UI</a>. The readme provides a pretty good overview. ‚ù§Ô∏è</span></p><p><span class="link">üëì <a href="https://github.com/oakmac/standard-clojure-style-js/">oakmac/standard-clojure-style-js: Standard Clojure Style in JavaScript</a> [clojure, tool]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Clojurists Together sponsored a new, minimally configurable and highly portable formatter for Clojure, inspired by Tonsky's proposed simple formatting rules. Will be interesting to see where this goes... (Written initially in JS, so that it is easy to include in VS Code, make a CLI, put in a werb library, ... .)</span></p><p><span class="link">üëì <a href="https://github.com/coder/wush">coder/wush simple & fast file transfer</a> [tool, cli]</span></p><p><span class="link">üëì <a href="https://github.com/igrishaev/deed">igrishaev/deed: Fast, flexible, 0-deps (de)serialization library for Clojure</a> [clojure, library] - <q>Fast, flexible, 0-deps (de)serialization library for Clojure - igrishaev/deed</q></span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">An interesting, if too fresh, alternative to Nippy for data serialization. Written in pure Java, claims to be 20-30% faster than Nippy, and offers a reportedly simpler API. Encryption and compression is not baked in as in Nippy, though wrapping with a GZIP*Stream is well supported. Serializes to an arbitrary stream, and knows how to serialize a number of types, including streams. Notice that Nippy by default serializes to a byte array, thus possibly doubling or tripling memory use. Deed also supports lazy reading and deserialization. </span></p><p><span class="link">üëì <a href="https://kamal-deploy.org/">Deploy web apps anywhere</a> [tool, devops]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Interesting looking tool for when you want to run your services on your own hardware, but with the ease of use and features that cloud deploys offer, such as zero-downtime deploys and rolling restarts. From vanilla Linux to deploy in minutes, reportedly. Leverages Docker. By 37signals.</span></p><p><span class="link">üëì <a href="https://injee.codeberg.page/">Injee - The no configuration instant database for frontend developers</a> [webdev, tool]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">A non-persistent, REST & JSON "database" making it possible for frontend developers to create an "instant API," while waiting for a proper one to be created. POST some entities, get them back, search and sort... . Pretty neat idea! And written in Clojure...</span></p><p><span class="link">üëì <a href="https://cel.dev/">CEL ¬†|¬† Common Expression Language</a> [library]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">I was looking for a library that would allow users to write expressions that transform data (primarily computing derived values), that would be simple and safe. CEL looks interesting - it is fast, extensible, allows subsetting, safe. It can be used also e.g. for encoding security/auth policies & checks, list filters in API calls, ... .</span></p><p><span class="link">üëì <a href="https://www.metosin.fi/blog/2024-09-26-on-seniority-and-acceptance">On Seniority and Acceptance - Metosin</a> [people, management]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Moving to more senior positions, the author has learned: 1. You see more problems than you can fix, 2. You can't expect [or make] a team to produce better quality than it knows how to. Actually, as you mature, you see more problems. Solution to #1 is prioritization (and saying no) and involving other people. Solution to #2 isn't quality control, but improving the team, giving the right mixture of support and freedom. And it requires that go of control. (Accept that you can't control the team's quality, and you can't solve all the problems.) Grow from intuitions into understanding / analysis. Make trade-offs. Multiple good points and food for thought here!</span></p><p><span class="link">üëì <a href="https://andersmurphy.com/2024/09/26/how-to-max-throughput-when-pulling-data-from-a-third-party-service.html">How to max throughput when pulling data from a third party service</a> [performance, api]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">A good list of things to think of when trying to maximize the throughput of your service, depending on 3rd party services - batching requests and DB writes, rate limiting, retry with backoff, not starving other users, ... .</span></p><p><span class="link">üëì <a href="https://zagjs.com/">Zag - Rapidly build UI components without sweating over the logic. - Zag</a> [webdev, library, ui]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">"A collection of framework-agnostic UI component patterns like accordion, menu, and dialog that can be used to build design systems for React, Vue, Solid.js and Svelte." But the really interesting part is that their logic is all powered by <a href="https://blog.jannikwempe.com/what-are-state-machines-and-statecharts#heading-statecharts">statecharts</a> (like fine state machines, but more powerful). (In Fulcro, UI State Machines are used a lot for these purposes, and are likely to be eventually replaced by <a href="https://fulcrologic.github.io/statecharts/">fulcrologic/statecharts</a>.) A founding realization was that we need a better way to model component logic.</span></p><p><span class="link">üëì <a href="https://clojure-goes-fast.com/blog/clojures-deadly-sin/">Clojure's deadly sin</a> [opinion, clojure, performance] - <q>This article is about laziness in Clojure. It is intended to be a comprehensive and objective (however possible) critique of lazy sequences </q></span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">"[..] intended to be a comprehensive and objective (however possible) critique of lazy sequences as a <em>feature</em>.</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Pros: Avoiding unnecessary work (when you only (take 10 ...)), infinite sequences such as (range), processing data without having to load all of it into memory.</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Cons: Aside of the performance overhead (in CPU and memory, due to creation of intermediary sequences), it is primarily the fact that lazy sequences don't play well with side effects. Namely, they will be triggered far from where they are in the code. F.ex. throwing exceptions (here, try-catch doesn't help when returning a lazy seq from it...), dynamic bindings (you are out of their scope when you come to actually executing the relevant code, releasing resources (e.g. if you try to return (with-open ... (line-seq ...))). Also, <a href="https://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/laziness/#lazy-sequences-chunking">lazy seq chunking</a> makes it hard to process a single element at a time. (Notice that some fns internally chunk the sequence they work on.)</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">To support all types of sequences including lazy, ISeq is not very optimal. From waling a 10k collection: "We see that it [loop with, effectively, first and rest] takes us 240 microseconds to merely iterate over that vector, and 400KB worth of objects gets allocated along the way. The second snippet uses doseq, which contains multiple chunking optimizations. Iteration with doseq is <strong>6 times faster</strong> than with loop, producing <strong>20 times less garbage</strong> on the heap. Finally, the reduce-based run! offers the same speed as doseq in this example while not allocating anything as it runs."</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">=> use mapv and friends, leverage transducers and possibyl eduction, remember doall...</span></p><p><span class="link">üëì <a href="https://kalabasa.github.io/htmz/">htmz - a low power tool for html</a> [webdev, framework]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">This is really cool and a very, very minimalist alternative to htmx. In its own words: "htmz is a minimalist HTML microframework for creating interactive and modular web user interfaces with the familiar simplicity of plain HTML. In a nutshell, htmz lets you swap page fragments on request using vanilla HTML.." 166B, no deps and JS bundles, plain HTML. Similar to and inspired by htmx, but much simpler. (Via Slipset.)</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">How does it work? You create a link such as <code>&lt;a href="/flower.html" target="#my-element"&gt;</code> to load the response HTML into the element with id mu-element. How? "htmz is an iframe named 'htmz'. You invoke htmz by loading a URL into the iframe via target=htmz. By using an iframe, we lean on the browser‚Äôs native capability to fetch the URL and parse the HTML. After loading the HTML resource, we take the resulting DOM via an onload handler." The latter, via document.querySelector(frame.contentWindow.location.hash || null)?.replaceWith(...frame.contentDocument.body.childNodes).</span></p><p><span class="link">üëì <a href="https://thomascothran.tech/2024/09/in-clojure/">Behavioral Programming in Clojure</a> [clojure, research]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">A short introduction into behavioral programming, with graphics and examples. As <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/research/behavioral-programming/#R26">the original B.P. paper</a> explains, B.P. is "A novel paradigm for programming reactive systems centered on naturally specified modular behavior." I.e. you can code each desired "behavior" independently of all others (= modularity, incremental specification of behavior), and they combine at runtime. A behavior is based around (sequences of) events and specifying what can, must, or may not happen following certain sequences of events. In particular, you can <em>request</em> a particular event to happen, <em>wait</em> on one, or <em>block</em> some. You can visualize a B.P program using <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Live-Sequence-Charts%3A-An-Introduction-to-Lines%2C-and-Brill-Damm/95417e9440255f9b7d4d5a784a03b2aae7c9f538">live sequence charts</a>. Reportedly, "Behavioral programming can be used to build very sophisticated behaviors from very simple building blocks. [...] Behavioral programs lend themselves to formal verification and to visualization. Behavioral programming has a sound theoretical foundation." Invented by David Harel, who also invented statecharts (not the <a href="https://fulcrologic.github.io/statecharts/">Clojure lib of the same name</a> :).)</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">IMHO it is nice and powerful to be able to specify behaviors independently (after all, it is how agents and human societies work)  but it will surely be hard to understand the behavior of such system. Though visualization and formal methods may help.</span></p><p><span class="link">üëì <a href="https://dora.dev/capabilities/trunk-based-development/">DORA | Capabilities: Trunk-based Development</a> [software development, process, productivity]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Trunk-based development (merge to mainline at least daily) vs. feature branches (multiple days or longer). (Some) research reportedly "shows that teams achieve higher levels of software delivery and operational performance (delivery speed, stability, and availability) if they follow these practices [of trunk-based dev]." Ways to improve: develop in small batches, perform synchronous code review, implement comprehensive automated testing, have a fast build.</span></p><p><span class="link">üëì <a href="https://blog.redplanetlabs.com/2024/10/10/rama-on-clojures-terms-and-the-magic-of-continuation-passing-style/">Rama on Clojure‚Äôs terms, and the magic of continuation-passing style</a> [rama]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">At the heart of <a href="https://blog.jakubholy.net/2023/exploring-rama/">Rama</a> is its dataflow language, a Clojure-based full-fledged programming language, which is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style">continuation-passing style</a> (CPS). This post explores how Rama works in comparison to equivalent Clojure code written in a CPS style. CPS through Rama greatly generalizes the basic concept of a function (into a <a href="https://redplanetlabs.com/docs/~/clj-dataflow-lang.html#_custom_operations">fragment</a>), which enables new ways of writing code in general, and is particularly liberating for writing parallel and asynchronous code. What makes Rama operations / fragments more general than functions is how they can emit multiple times, not emit at all, or emit asynchronously. The ability to emit asynchronously is what makes Rama so good for writing parallel and asynchronous code.</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">A good way to understand CPS and Rama's CPS better. More highlights:</span><ul><li>CPS and the ability to emit asynchronously unifies general purpose programming with distributed programming, by enabling parallel code to be expressed no differently than any other logic. Partitioners enable Rama code to precisely control not just what is executing, but where.</li><li>Dataflow turns CPS into a full-fledged programming paradigm. Emitting zero times, multiple times, asynchronously, or to multiple output streams are major generalizations of functions that open up huge new avenues to explore in the craft of programming.</li></ul></p><p><span class="link">üëì <a href="https://dvliman.com/post/my-handy-clojure-debugging-tools/">My handy Clojure debugging tools</a> [clojure, troubleshooting, tool]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">A neat DIY way to capture local values, with corresponding expressions, with leveraging a user-level user.clj and profile and a custom reader tag.</span></p><p><span class="link">üëì <a href="https://www.instantdb.com/essays/next_firebase">InstantDB: A Modern Firebase</a> [database, webdev, service]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">An essay explaining the reasons for creating InstantDB, a "A Graph-Based Firebase" (database as a service with an API). InstantDB has relational queries, auth, and permissions and supports optimistic updates, "multiplayer" (user's changes are propagated to all others), and offline mode. These last three capabilities arguably make an app way better, and transform how you use it. The article discusses first the general architecture of such as webapp-and-DB system (a normalized in-browser store turned into a graph for each screen, and with mutations that apply both to the local store and the remote DB) and then dives into the integrated solution Instant delivers, with a "Local DB" that understands graph queries and handles normalization, caching, and syncing with the backend. Instant is based on a triple store (id, attribute, value), and has a datalog-like query language at its core, and a UI-friendly InstaQL on top of it.</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Note: Firebase has reportedly two problems: 1) It is only a document store, without support for relations; 2) Its permission language is too weak and gets very complex very quickly.</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Related: <a href="https://www.instantdb.com/essays/db_browser">A Database in the Browser</a> argues that the schleps we face as UI engineers are actually database problems in disguise (and InstantDB tries to be the solution for that).</span></p><p><span style="white-space: pre-line;"><blocquote>Many think we need to resort to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation">operational transforms</a> to do stuff like this [resolving concurrent updates to data], but as figma showed, as long as we‚Äôre okay with having a single leader, and are fine with last-write-wins kind of semantics, we can drastically simplify this and just facts are enough. When time for even more serious resolution comes, you can open up the OT rabbit hole.

With Electric, you don't need to manually transfer data to the client and deal with state management there. Instead, you write your full-stack app in cljc files, with e/client and e/server markers, and let the compiler figure out the split and network communication for you. I've been rather skeptical of the feasibility of this, but Dustin & Co. have put a lot of thought into it and it seems to actually work. (At least for rather interactive, backoffice and business apps without need for pixel perfection.)</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">You cannot just drop Electric into your code base and expect everything to work magically, there is some learning curve, even though the rules are sane and intuitive. You have to understand how Electric works and what piece of code runs where and when data crosses the network, and you need to learn Electric's superset of Clojure, with e/fn, e/for, an asynchronous let (since some parts of it may run on the server, others, concurrently, on the client), and get used to work with "differential reactive streams / signals" (= streams of diff info) instead of sequences of raw data. But compared to the complexity of React and manual state and network management, you are much better off anyway - and you get fine grained reactivity, where only changes are transferred and directly alter the relevant DOM (using the built-in dom library).</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">This talk introduces Electric v3 and improvements since v2, with fewer pitfalls and less need for macros. It is fascinating that all of this has been built by just four people. I am very much looking forward to actually trying this out and seeing for myself how well it works.</span></p><p><span class="link">üëì <a href="https://atlas.mindmup.com/holyjak/sw_engineer_questions_/">Mike Acton‚Äôs Expectations of Professional Software Engineers</a> [best practices, software development]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Mike has about <a href="https://adamj.eu/tech/2022/06/17/mike-actons-expectations-of-professional-software-engineers/">50 questions he expects all professional software engineers</a> he works with to be able to answer.

The construction of such a direct manipulation interface may appear straightforward, but there are some significant challenges. First, individual direct manipulation operations cannot be too complex, so expressive power has to be achieved through composing (long) sequences of small operations. Second, all intermediate results are visible to the user, so grouping and ordering are material after every small step. Third, users often find the need to modify previously specified queries. Since manipulations are specified one step at a time, there is no actual query expression to modify. Suitable means must be provided to address this need. Fourth, the order in which manipulations are performed by the user should not affect the results obtained, to avoid user confusion.</blocquote></span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Shamelessly stolen from the <a href="https://live24.clerk.vision/">Live Programming a Live Programming Environment: An Experience Report.</a></span></p><p><span class="link">üëì <a href="https://live24.clerk.vision/">This is very meta: using the moldable interactive coding tool Clerk to build a Clerk-based report builder inside Clerk...
