== What is happening

Good news, everyone! Me and Thomas have got https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/q1-2024-funding-announcement/[Clojurists Together funding for Wolframite] in Q2/2024. The primary goal is to stabilize the API and release it, and make great docs. We are even in touch with Wolfram Engineering, which will hopefully help us make the integration rock solid. This month I have https://github.com/scicloj/wolframite/pull/26[reworked interning] of Wolfram symbols as vars to be more efficient and predictable, https://github.com/scicloj/wolframite/commit/db19713b241a9299107143c073b1c416fc97ba8f[simplified customization of Wolfram response parsing], made the https://github.com/scicloj/wolframite/pull/25[discovery of Mathematice / Wolfram] Kernel better and more robust, and further improved the docs. Daniel Slutsky has kindly added a demo of making web-rendered notebooks https://github.com/scicloj/wolframite/blob/main/dev/kindly_demo.clj[with Wolframite and Kindly]. (https://scicloj.github.io/kindly-noted/kindly.html[Kindly] is an emerging SciCloj standard for visualizing data with various backends, such as Portal and Clerk.)

I have also worked on my fulcro-troubleshooting to https://github.com/holyjak/fulcro-troubleshooting/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v10---2024-01-14[remove some false positives], which required a small fix of Fulcro to ensure that also https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro/pull/550[hooks-based components have a correct parent] setting (released in 3.7.1). I've also added there a Component-inspired improvement to https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro/pull/551[print the recursive fulcro-app map in a safe] way.

I have only spent a few hours with Rama, primarily studying the https://redplanetlabs.com/docs/~/index.html#gsc.tab=0[tutorial and docs], as my https://blog.jakubholy.net/2023/hands-on-rama-day1/[first day of Rama coding] taught me that it is hard to program when there is so much I don't know. I have got quite far now.

As they write and we have ourselves experienced, "Postgres’ native search features, which are pleasant to use but nowhere near as capable as a full search engine". They have released two Pg extensions: products: <a href="https://pgt.dev/extensions/pg_bm25">pg_bm25</a>, which enables full text search in Postgres (and uses the same algorithm, BM25, as E.S.), and <a href="https://pgt.dev/extensions/pg_sparse">pg_sparse</a>, which enables sparse vector search using HNSW in Postgres. Their full-text search can search by keyword or phrase with configurable tokenizers, stemming for 17 languages, and an extensible SQL-based query language. Written in Rust, open source.</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">They are also working on a hosted solution.</span></p><p><span class="link">👓 <a href="https://kerkour.com/jwt">JSON Web Tokens are actually great, just not for sessions</a> [security, best practices]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">An experienced security expert shares his tips for a good use of the popular JWTs. Summary: The specification is large and complex, but it has good parts you can leverage. Do not use [stateless] JWT tokens (typically from Auth as a Service) for sessions or as api keys - since you have no way to revoke such a token. But they are great for authenticating specific, short actions, such as a download or password reset. Read the whole article for all the tips, if you plan to implement JWTs.</span></p><p><span class="link">👓 <a href="https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2024/01/03/async-rust-2024/">What I'd like to see for Async Rust in 2024 🎄 · baby steps</a> [rust, opinion, future]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Async Rust and what happened in 2023 and is possible in 2024.

This efficiency is achieved without compromising readability, flexibility, or discoverability." </span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">The <a href="https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-structure">document structure</a>'s top keys are data, errors, meta, links plus few other that may be there. Every "resource object" must have an id and type and may have attributes (a map of all its other properties), relationships (to other json:api resources ~ foreign keys in SQL; must have 1+ of links, meta, data: {type, id} (or array)), links, meta. </span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Related resources (e.g. an article's author) <a href="https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-compound-documents">may be also included</a> in the response alongside the primary resource, in the top-level included array (I'd have preferred type -> id lookup). The client requests this, with a list of relationship paths to include.

It enables you to describe a range of URIs and then create a concrete one by supplying a map of variables. It is smarter than just string interpolation - query params will be properly separated by ? and &, variables without provided values are removed from the template, and there is a number of parameters to control the expansion (e.g. to insert only a substring of the value), values are url-encoded, lists comma-separated, & more.</span></p><p><span class="link">👓 <a href="https://designsystems.surf/">Design Systems Database: Surf among top‑notch Design Systems</a> [webdev, ux design]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;"><a href="https://frontendfoc.us/link/150337/86c8c88ea8">Design Systems Database: A Database of Best-in-Class Design Systems, Organized and Sorted by Components and Directories</a> — Useful for studying the public design systems of well-known technical teams (Adobe, GitHub, MailChimp, Shopify, etc.), divided into systems, directories, components, and blueprints.

The main arguments are the growing complexity of React and the churn in the ecosystem, due to the constant changes. A good way forward seems to be a pure cljs implementation of the core ideas of React, without all the ballast. Such as the (under-documented) <a href="https://github.com/thheller/shadow-grove">shadow-grove</a> by Thomas Heller and early stage <a href="https://github.com/cjohansen/replicant">Replicant</a> (though it isn't clear yet whether the authors will continue with it, or adopt shadow-grove instead).</span></p><p><span class="link">👓 <a href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/rocks-pebbles-sand/">Rocks, Pebbles, Sand: How to implement in practice</a> [project management, process]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">A great article about the three categories of tasks (the large, 3-6(-12) month strategic "rocks" with multi-year impact, tactical, 1-4 sprint "pebbles", and <= 1 sprint, team-driven "sand"), about their <em>different goals,</em> and about the <em>different planning and prioritization</em> processes they need. The names remind us that we need to plan the largest ones first, just as when fitting rocks, pebbles, and sand into a jar. Be aware of their differences, and schedule and prioritize accordingly.</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Sand [scheduled by devs] - "tiny" tasks with immeasurable impact, which adds up to a great product. Mostly comes from Engineering. optimizer for throughput (=> do minimize process). Prioritize with intuition and desire, not math and metrics. many never will get done because we always have more ideas than time. Since delivered-value is near-nil, why not choose things people have desire / energy for? This increases happiness, morale, and often quality.</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Rocks [scheduled by exec, but PM drives] - strategic (=> winning over the next few years) , 3-6(-12) month, optimize for impact, which must be huge. Powers up the product.</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Pebbles [scheduled by PM] maximize ROI, i.e. effort vs impact. Between sand and rocks (1-4 sprints), not strategic but tactical wins with impact in the next few months. "It is difficult to craft great Pebbles, because impactful things have a tendency to explode in effort. Anything longer than four sprints invokes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter&apos;s_law">Hofstadter problem</a> of time and impact, and therefore must be analyzed and prioritized as a Rock." If it starts expanding," you often discover that the impact is no longer big enough. Either this means the team needs to get more creative in how to deliver more impact with less effort, or maybe this idea simply isn’t a good-enough use of your time. "
If Rocks maximize strategic impact over the long-term, Pebbles maximize immediate impact in the short-term. Said another way: They are the “most effective use of the team’s precious time.”
Beware impact & time estimates mostly off by tens of %.</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Many great points about prioritising, handling conflicting priorities, and ensuring that none of the three categories is starved. I especially appreciated "Starting a new Rock or Pebble too soon, rather than creating more quality and value from the ones that just “completed".</span></p>
