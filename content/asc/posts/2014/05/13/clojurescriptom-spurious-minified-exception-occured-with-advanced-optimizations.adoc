After having upgraded to Om 0.6.3. and ClojureScript 2197, I suddenly got the following error in the browser when loading the .js compiled with <code>:optimizations :advanced</code>:
<blockquote>Uncaught Error: Minified exception occured; use the non-minified dev environment for the full error message and additional helpful warnings.</blockquote>
In the dev mode, i.e. without any optimizations, the code worked just fine - the same thing that <a href="https://logs.lazybot.org/irc.freenode.net/%23clojurescript/2014-04-24.txt">Frozenlock has experienced</a>.<br><br>After downgrading, removing Om, and upgrading again it suddnely dissapeared and now Om 0.6.3. and ClojureScript 2197 work just fine. So I suppose that after having changed the versions, I should have properly deleted all generated files (and not just my myapp.min.js).<br><br>I hope this helps to somebody.
