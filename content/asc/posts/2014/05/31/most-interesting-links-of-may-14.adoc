	<li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/http2/">http2 explained</a> (pdf, 27 pages) - cons of http 1 (huge spec / no full impl., wasteful use of TCP &lt;=&gt; latency [x spriting, inlining, concatenation, sharding]) =&gt; make it less latency sensitive, fix pipelining (issue a req before previous one finished), stop the need for ever increasing # connections, remove/reduce optional parts of http. Http2 is binary; multiple "streams" over 1 connection =&gt; much less conns, faster data delivery; header/data compression; [predictive] resource pushing; . Inspired by SPDY. Chrome and Mozilla will only support it over TLS, yay! (see also <a href="https://istlsfastyet.com/">Is TLS Fast Yet?</a> [yes, it is]) Promise: faster, more responsive web pages &amp; deprecation of http/1 workarounds =&gt; simplified web dev.</li>

<h2>Clojure Corner</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enwIIGzhahw">core.async walkthrough for practicioners</a> (12/2013; original title "Core.Async") - Tim Baldrige 40m talk from Conj is a must-watch for anybody that wants to understand and use core.async. <a href="https://github.com/halgari/clojure-conj-2013-core.async-examples">Examples from and beyond the talk</a> are at GitHub. Highlights: While take! takes a callback, &lt;!!  wraps that into a promise so that it blocks and returns the value. Thread is similar to future, running the code asynchronously, but returns a channel instead of a promise. So does go, only it does not use real threads but simulated light-weight ones via a state machine and parking. Tim shows the different buffers (normal, dropping = earliest values kept, sliding = latest valus kept). Other topics: alts!!, ...
