<em>Few tips for troubleshooting Ansible, based on my brief experiences with Ansible 1.4 (read: do not rely on this info too much).</em>
<h2>Run ansible-playbook in the verbose mode</h2>
<tt>ansible-playbook -vvvv ...</tt> will provide you with plenty of details of what is going on. (Notice that additional v:s, starting from none, add more detail.)
<h2><a href="https://github.com/holyjak/ansible/blob/devel/docsite/rst/playbooks_troubleshooting.rst#use-hackingtest-module" name="use-hackingtest-module"></a>Use ./hacking/test-module</h2>
Check out Ansible sources and use the <tt>./hacking/test-module</tt> script - see <a href="https://github.com/holyjak/ansible/blob/devel/docsite/rst/playbooks_troubleshooting.rst#id1">Developing Modules</a>.<br><br><!--more-->
<h2><a href="https://github.com/holyjak/ansible/blob/devel/docsite/rst/playbooks_troubleshooting.rst#keep-remote-files-and-execute-them-manually" name="keep-remote-files-and-execute-them-manually"></a>Keep remote files and execute them manually</h2>
<em>Note: This is quite a hack; it is preferred to use the the test-module.</em><br><br>Set the environment variable <tt>ANSIBLE_KEEP_REMOTE_FILES=1</tt> to keep files that Ansible copied to the server so that you can execute them directly on the server yourself and thus troubleshoot them better:
<pre>$ export ANSIBLE_KEEP_REMOTE_FILES=1
$ ansible-playbook ...</pre>
Then, on the server, in the home directory of the user used for ssh-ing, look into <tt>.ansible/tmp/ansible-&lt;unique id&gt;/&lt;module name or "arguments"&gt;</tt>. F.ex. to execute manually a command that has failed:
<pre>$ python ./ansible-1392625678.65-85585787027596/command</pre>

The command is perhaps waiting for user input. Always make sure to execute commands in a non-interactive mode if possible.<br><br>Try to find the command process on the server and kill it while running Ansible with <tt>-vvvv</tt> or/and use <tt>ANSIBLE_KEEP_REMOTE_FILES</tt>and run the Ansible files manually, as suggested above.

Ansible currently doesn't handle SSH problems very transparently, even when run with <tt>-vvvv</tt>. Such a failure could be caused by SSH asking to accept the node's key. In each case, exclude SSH as the cause by SSH-ing into the node manually in the same way as Ansible does so when you run Ansible, it will already have been added to <tt>known_hosts</tt>.<br><br><em>Note: I believe this is fixed/improved in Ansible 1.5</em>.
