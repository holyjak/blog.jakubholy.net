	<li><a href="https://nathanmarz.com/blog/principles-of-software-engineering-part-1.html">Nathan Marz: Principles of Software Engineering, Part 1</a> - Nathan has worked with Big Data at Twitter and other places and really knows the perils or large, distributed, real-time systems and this post contains plenty of valuable advice for making robust, reliable SW. Main message: "<em>there's a lot of <strong>uncertainty</strong> in software engineering</em>"; every SW operates correctly only for a certain range of inputs (including volume, HW it runs on, ...) and you never control all of them so there always is an opportunity for failure; you can't predict what inputs you will encounter in the wild. <em>"[..] while software is deterministic, you can't treat it as deterministic in any sort of practical sense if you want to build robust software.</em>" "<em><strong>Making software robust is an iterative process</strong>: you build and test it as best you can, but inevitably in production you'll discover new areas of the input space that lead to failure. Like rockets, it's <strong>crucial to have excellent monitoring</strong> in place so that these issues can be diagnosed.</em>". From the content: Sources of uncertainty (bugs, humans, requirements, inputs, ..), Engineering for uncertainty (minimize dependencies, lessen % of cascading failure [JH: -&gt; <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix">Hystrix</a>], measure and monitor)

	<li><a href="https://nathanmarz.com/blog/suffering-oriented-programming.html">Suffering-oriented programming</a> is certainly also worth reading (summary: do not start with great designs; only start generalizing and creating libs when you have suffered enough from doing things more manually and thus learned the domain; make it possible &gt; make it beautiful &gt; make it fast, repeat)</li>

	<li><a href="https://mooc.cs.helsinki.fi/clojure">MOOC course Functional programming with Clojure</a> at Uni of Helsinki - to get started you need, I suppose, follow the "<a href="https://iloveponies.github.io/120-hour-epic-sax-marathon/index.html">Material and course content</a>" - essentially read the text for each chapter, clone its repo, submit pull requests to get your work graded</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/case-continuous-delivery">Jez Humble: The Case for Continuous Delivery</a> - read to persuade manager about CD: "Still, many managers and executives remain unconvinced as to the benefits [of CD], and would like to know more about the economic drivers behind CD." CD reduces waste: "[..]online controlled experiments (A/B tests) at Amazon. This approach created hundreds of millions of dollars of value[..]," reduces risks: "[..] Etsy, has a great <a href="https://www.usievents.com/en/conferences/8-paris-usi-2011/sessions/968-john-allspaw">presentation</a> which describes how deploying more frequently improves the stability of web services." CD makes development cheaper by reducing the cost of non-value-adding activities such as integration and testing. F.ex. HP got dev. costs down by 40%, dev cost/program by 78%</li>

	<li><a href="https://soundadvice.id.au/blog/2009/06/13/">The REST Statelessness Constraint</a> - a nice post about statelessness in REST if you, like me, don't know REST so much in depth; highlights: Statelesness (and thus the requirement for clients to send their state with every request) is a trade-off crucial for web-scale and partially balanced by caching - while typical enterprise apps have different needs (more state, less scale) so REST isn't a perfect match. Distinguish application (client-side) and server (resources) state. Using a DB to hold the state still violates the requirement. Use links to transfer some state (e.g. contain a link to fetch the next page of records in the response).</li>

	<li><a href="https://edgeperspectives.typepad.com/edge_perspectives/2011/11/cognitive-biases-in-times-of-uncertainty.html">Cognitive Biases in Times of Uncertainty</a> - people under pressure/stress start to focus on risks over gains and (very) short-term rather than long-term and thus also adopt 0-some mindset (i.e. if sb. else wins, I loose) =&gt; polarization into we x them and focus on getting as big piece of the cake possible at any price, now, dismissal of collaboration. With accelerating rate of change in the society due to technology, this is exactly what is happening. How to counter it? Create more positive narratives than the threat-based ones (views of the world), support them via short-term gains. Bottom line: each of us must work on spreading a more positive attitude to save us from bleak future.</li>

	<li><a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/blog/2014/02/17/local-state-is-harmful/">Local state is harmful</a> - how can we answer the questions about when/why did state X change, how did output Y get where it is? Make state explicit, f.ex. one global map holding all of it, and perhaps not just the current state but also history - thus we can easily query it. Prismatic' Graph can be used to make the state map, watches to keep history. Inspired by databases (Datomic is an excellent example of SW where answering such questions is trivial)</li>
