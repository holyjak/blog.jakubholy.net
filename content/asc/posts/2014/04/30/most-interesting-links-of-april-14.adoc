<ul>
	<li><a href="https://johannesbrodwall.com/2014/03/24/the-economics-of-reuse/">The economics of reuse</a> - developing code for reuse costs much more than for one need - it might cost 300% more to develop and save you 75% of work when (re)using it instead of developing from scratch (if one of the factors goes down, the other one typically goes down too). Summary: "<em>That means that <strong>to get any value from your reused component, you better have five or more reusers</strong> or you have to find a way to substantially improve the [reuse value factor] or [reusability cost factor]. Very smart people have failed to do this.</em>"</li>

Sharing data on the web
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.heppnetz.de/projects/goodrelations/">GoodRelations: The Web Vocabulary for E-Commerce</a> - make data about your company, products, opening hours etc. more SEO-friendly and understandable to a computer by <a href="https://wiki.goodrelations-vocabulary.org/Quickstart#HTML_Patterns_for_Rich_Markup">adding some semantic markup</a>. If more sites did this, the web would be much easier to navigate. (GoodRelations has been added almost entirely to the <a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a> vocabulary so you can use just schema.org with microdata or <a href="https://wiki.goodrelations-vocabulary.org/Cookbook/Schema.org">schema.org where possible and G.R. to extend it</a>.)</li>

<h2>Clojure Corner</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://blog.8thlight.com/andrew-zures/2014/03/08/combining-clj-and-cljs-libraries.html">8th Light: Combining Clojure and ClojureScript Libraries</a> (3/2014) - really good and detailed article / tutorial using <a href="https://github.com/lynaghk/cljx">CLJX</a> and platform-specific platform.clj[s] files to share code between Clojure and ClojureScript. It also recommends a file structure (src/(clj|cljs)/), demonstrates testing, discusses macro development, shows how to pack both into one jar.</li>
