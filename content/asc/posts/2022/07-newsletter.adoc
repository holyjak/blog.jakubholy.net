Welcome to the Holy Dev newsletter, which brings you gems I found on the web, updates from my blog, and a few scattered thoughts. You can get the next one into your mailbox if you link:/me/subscribe[subscribe].

== What is happening
Thanks to a client I have explored how to integrate Fulcro components with vanilla JS higher-order components that render the target Fulcro component (possibly requiring to be passed a class, not an actual element) and/or want to pass it a "ref" to get / provide access to a DOM element. You can read all about it in https://blog.jakubholy.net/2022/forward-ref-in-fulcro/[Using React.forwardRef in Fulcro (and rendering a Fulcro component from a JS one)]. I have also got my https://github.com/quoll/asami/pull/2[improvements to Asami] merged and thus have been able to release the first, alpha version of https://github.com/holyjak/fulcro-rad-asami[fulcro-rad-asami] for using Asami is the database backing a Fulcro RAD app. Other than that, I have had great two weeks of vacation with friends and family :-)

<p><span class="link">ðŸ‘“ <a href="https://github.com/datafold/data-diff?ref=console.dev">datafold/data-diff at console.dev</a> [tool, database]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">data-diffÂ splits the table into smaller segments, then checksums each segment in both databases. When the checksums for a segment aren't equal, it will further divide that segment into yet smaller segments, checksumming those until it gets to the differing row(s). A CLI and Python library. </span></p><p><span class="link">ðŸ‘“ <a href="https://github.com/BrianChevalier/radiant">BrianChevalier/radiant: Write full featured CSS as Clojure data structures, inline</a> [clojure, library, clojurescript, webdev]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Similar to the older <a href="https://github.com/noprompt/garden">Garden</a>, Radiant enables you to write CSS as clojure data structures and generates css classes from these. Built-in support for Hiccup and Reagent and DIY using the API. Programatically create and reuse styles similar to <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">tailwindcss</a> with merge. Radiant aims to be easily replaceable and not be coupled to your code. It also tries to stay as close to vanilla CSS as possible with as little Radiant-specific learning as possible.</span></p><p><span class="link">ðŸ‘“ <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/e72-data-processing-with-chris-nuernberger-part-1/id1461500416?i=1000565597470">â€ŽClojureStream Podcast: E72 Data Processing with Chris Nuernberger (part 1) on Apple Podcasts</a> [clojure, library, data processing] - <q>â€ŽShow ClojureStream Podcast, Ep E72 Data Processing with Chris Nuernberger (part 1) - Jun 7, 2022</q></span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">I really enjoyed this deep dive into tech.ml.dataset and the underlying dtype-next and learning about efficient computations on the JVM and via external, native libraries (such as those from Python or Julia). It turns out you can thing about these is essentially a high-performance, in-memory, column-oriented database.
(There is also <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/e73-data-processing-with-chris-nuernberger-part-2/id1461500416?i=1000567344804">Part 2</a>.)</span></p><p><span class="link">ðŸ‘“ <a href="https://github.com/nubank/matcher-combinators">nubank/matcher-combinators: Library for creating matcher combinator to compare nested data structures</a> [clojure, library, testing]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Flexible matchers for testing, supporting both primitive values (incl. regexp vs. string) and collections. Use value or a predicate, order-less comparison, maps only check specified keys. It looks really useful.</span></p><p><span style="white-space: pre-line;"><strong>In-process libs for a processing pipeline as a DAG of actions</strong><br /></span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;"><a href="https://clojurians.slack.com/archives/CQT1NFF4L/p1657482280025899">From Clojurians Slack</a>, key contributions by Adrian Smith, respatilized, Ben Sless.</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Ben Sless' <strong><a href="https://github.com/bsless/more.async/blob/master/doc/dataflow.org">more.async/dataflow</a></strong> for composing simple core.async processes, inspired by Onyx.</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;"><strong><a href="https://github.com/bob-cd/bob">Bob CI</a></strong><strong> </strong>(uses XTDB for persistence)</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;"><a href="https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx"><strong>Onyx</strong></a>Â - written with distributed computation in mind but as far as I know nothing prevents running it entirely in memory on a single node. Designed exactly for the type of dynamic workflow definition you describe. The docs are extremely thoughtfully written, describing exactly <a href="http://www.onyxplatform.org/docs/user-guide/0.13.x/#_an_information_model">why an information model is superior to an API</a></span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;"><strong><a href="https://github.com/agentbellnorm/dativity">Dativity</a></strong><strong>Â -Â </strong>a 'stateless process engine' that allows DAG-like computation by dispatching functions on the basis of what the data looks like at a given point in time. Not sure how dynamic it can be at runtime, though.</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;"><a href="https://github.com/schmee/daguerreo"><strong>Daguerreo</strong></a>- explicitly patterned after Apache Airflow but designed to run in-process.</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;"><strong><a href="https://github.com/kennytilton/matrix">Matrix</a></strong> ("Fine-grained, transparent data flow between generative objects.") - it's kind of at the boundary between reactive programming and DAG computation.</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;"><a href="https://cljdoc.org/d/io.framed/overseer/0.8.9/doc/what-is-overseer-"><strong>Overseer</strong></a>Â - (see above description, basically - but stores job state in Datomic)</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;"><a href="https://titanoboa.io/"><strong>Titanoboa</strong></a> (though not in-process)</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Note: Dynamic manipulation of the DAG and full state inspection are generally missing in these.</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">An article by respatialized on the topic: Â <strong><a href="https://fabricate.site/background/finite-schema-machines.html">Organizing Computation With Finite Schema Machines</a></strong><strong>,Â </strong>where he outlines his thinking about how to solve a similar problem usingÂ malliÂ schemas without pulling in a library like one of those.</span></p><p><span class="link">ðŸ‘“ <a href="https://bun.sh/">Bun is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime</a> [webdev, tool, javascript]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">A would-be replacement for Node.js and a competitor to Deno, build in Zig with focus on performance and fast start (aiming to run in edge functions) and being an all-in-one tool, with built-in transpiling and bundling (so TypeScript and JSX work out of the box). It implements 90% of Node.js API (contrary to Deno), making it a viable drop-in replacement. Built on JavaScriptCore rather than V8. It will be interesting to see where this goes.</span></p><p><span class="link">ðŸ‘“ <a href="https://github.com/ykskb/phrag">ykskb/phrag: GraphQL API created from an RDBMS connection for instant, flexible and customizable CRUD operations.</a> [clojure, library, webdev, graphql]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">GraphQL API from an RDBMS Connection (leveraging the DB's metadata), with focus on simplicity.

Customizable processing via <em>interceptors</em> - configured per table & operation type and at pre/post DB operations. Tries to create a single SQL joining multiple tables when necessary. It comes with a <a href="https://github.com/ykskb/phrag#poc-project">demo project</a> you can explore. Currently supports SQLite and PostgreSQL.</span></p><p><span class="link">ðŸ‘“ <a href="https://projectcalico.docs.tigera.io/about/about-calico">About Calico</a> [devops, cloud, networking]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Calico is an open source networking and network security solution for containers, virtual machines, and native host-based workloads. From Kubernetes to bare metal. It provides developers and cluster operators with a consistent experience and set of capabilities whether running in public cloud or on-prem, on a single node, or across a multi-thousand node cluster.</span></p><p><span style="white-space: pre-line;"><strong>Can I un-chunk lazy sequences to realize one element at a time?</strong><br /></span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">No. If you need control over when elements are realized, you cannot use lazy sequences (which are <a href="https://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/laziness/">chunked by default, realizing 32</a> elements at a time). You are better off using transducers. </span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Transducers allow us when each element is <em>processed</em> but what about the input sequence? EvenÂ clojure.core/sequenceÂ realizes the first argument prematurely from a pragmatic standpoint. So in practice you need a sequence impl that doesn't do that and which relies on a concrete type that specifically realizes one element per call to first/next, which in practice lazy-seq with a single cons call in it whose rest is a recursive call does this, but that relies on an implementation detail of lazy-seq so could more correctly be implemented with a reify.</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">(From a <a href="https://clojurians.slack.com/archives/C03S1KBA2/p1657737383013229">Slack discussion</a> with contributions from Alex Miller, Joshua Suskalo, and others.)</span></p><p><span class="link">ðŸ‘“ <a href="https://tauri.app/blog/tauri_1_0/">Tauri 1.0 Release | Tauri Apps</a> [library, rust, gui]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Tauri, the high-security, cross-platform toolkit for building dekstop GUIs powered by Rust and web technologies has reached version 1.0. (A little like Electron but faster, smaller, leveraging the OS' native web view, and allowing you also to use Rust instead of JavaScript.)</span></p><p><span class="link">ðŸ‘“ <a href="https://github.com/brendonovich/prisma-client-rust">Brendonovich/prisma-client-rust: An autogenerated and fully type-safe database client for Prisma</a> [rust, library, database]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Prisma Client Rust is an autogenerated query builder that provides simple and fully type-safe database access without macros or domain-specific languages. It is an alternative to ORMs like Diesel and SeaORM and tools like SQLx. Prisma Client Rust provides a much more consistent and understandable API than other ORMs, which typically hide a lot of code with macros</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">(<a href="https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx">SQLx</a> is also interesting: async, pure Rust SQL crate featuring (optionally) compile-time checked queries without a DSL; also not an ORM.)</span></p><p><span class="link">ðŸ‘“ <a href="https://babashka.org/toolbox/">The Babashka Toolbox</a> [clojure, learning]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">A categorised directory of libraries and tools for Babashka, with relevant entries tagged as pod or built-in.

It covers what it is, and the features that have contributed to its success (simple runtime, portable, security). From there, it discusses various use cases, many of which are non-browser. Thereâ€™s an interesting section on companies and projects that use WebAssembly, and why, and finally, what the future might look like. It is also very balanced, with a small section looking at competing technologies, and a section that discusses what WebAssembly is not good at.</span></p><p><span class="link">ðŸ‘“ <a href="https://www.majesticons.com/">Majesticons premium icons for designers and developers</a> [webdev, styling]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Majestic looking iconset with 720 free MIT License icons in two styles.

Interestingly we can see a strong inspiration by Clojure and Datomic, including a link to a Rich Hickey's talk.</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">State consists of ordered immutable snapshots. Readers might get a slightly outdated but always consistent view of it (similar to the "db value" in Datomic). Internally the data is stored as subject-attribute-value triplets.</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">It also adopts reactivity (thanks to knowing which UI elements query for what data) and React-like approach of re-rendering only the minimal changed subset of the UI.</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">I am sure other parts of the series are also worth checking out.</span></p><p><span class="link">ðŸ‘“ <a href="https://www.voorhoede.nl/en/blog/how-to-multilingual-website-rtl-html-css/">How to: Make your multilingual website suitable for RTL</a> [webdev, styling] - <q>Making a multilingual website?
