<p>While refactoring a relatively simple Clojure code to use a map instead of a vector,
I have wasted perhaps a few hours due to essentially type errors. I want to share
the experience and my thoughts about possible solutions since I encounter this
problem quite often. I should mention that it is quite likely that it is more a
problem (an opportunity? :-)) with me rather than the language, namely with the
way I write and (not) test it.</p>
<p>The core of the problem is that I write chains of transformations based on my
sometimes flawed idea of what data I have at each stage. The challenge is that
I cannot see what the data is and have to maintain a mental model while writing
the code, and I suck at it. Evaluating the code in the REPL as I develop it helps
somewhat but only when writing it - not when I decide to refactor it.</p>
<p>A typical example of an error-prone code:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-clojure"><pre>(<span class="pl-en">-&gt;&gt;</span> data
     expr1  <span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">;</span> this is often a core function, a keyword, sometimes my own fn</span>
     ...
     exprI  <span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">;</span> &lt;-- suddenly I get here a nil, an empty seq, an exception, or just miss the expected data</span>
     ...
     exprN)</pre></div>
<p>I have struggled with the question <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/clojure/qqJaaT3vDWY/discussion" rel="nofollow">how to do a refactoring of data in Clojure in
a safer way before and got some useful tips</a>.)</p>

<p>I see three possible solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make it possible to see the data as it flows through the transformation, i.e.
the last data produced by each expression during the last execution. LightTable's
watches and insta-repl can do this and J.P. Posma called this "omniscient debugging"
and demonstrated how it can be done in JavaScript in his StrangeLoop talk
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2010&amp;v=Ml6Dp3F4Inc" rel="nofollow">Visualising program execution</a>.
This is how programming should work anyway.
(Preferably with having a control over what/how data is shown and being able to interact with
it to explore it.) However I haven't managed to get this working in LT with my
ClojureScript project (due to a weird "Can't dynamically bind non-dynamic var:
clojure.tools.reader/resolve-symbol at line 1  ::
{:file nil, :line 1, :column 61, :tag :cljs/analysis-error").</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <code>core.typed</code> to define the shape of the data and let the type checker
verify that my code conforms to it at each stage. [Core.typed has its own challenges](TODO: CircleCI blog)
but in this case it would help me nicely. Sadly the ClojureScript integration is
currently not up to date. Alternatively I could use Prismatic Schema, which
makes it possible to specify &amp; check the expected shape of the data but can't, I believe,
really help to check that each step of a transformation makes sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop a little differently. David Nolen has recommended the following approach
that I could try to apply more, though it doesn't feel 100% suitable solution for
the particular problem I have encountered: Try something at the REPL first, then
and pre/post-conditions around that. but do not get crazy with :pre/post, f.ex.
only add them at entry points. And of course have a good dose of cljs.test.

<p>The problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>I forgot that variations was a map, not a sequence. The code "worked" but the
<code>:type</code> wasn't added to the variations. Spotting why was made even more
difficult by having limited <code>print</code> to max 10 items and depth 3
(to prevent timouts) and thus not printing the keys and structures
relevant for the mistake.</li>
<li>Due to the inconsistency between <code>-&gt;sku+name</code> taking a collection and <code>-&gt;vec</code>
taking a single item, I've mistakenly used <code>(-&gt;vec)</code> instead of <code>(map -&gt;vec)</code>.
Again the code "worked" but did not do the expected thing so after fixing #1
and sending through a map, the code started to fail at another place and I
couldn't figure out why.</li>
<li>After fixing #1 and #2, the transformation again stopped doing the expected
thing and all availableQuantities were nil. It wasn't easy to spot that it
was because I have switched from using <code>:&lt;sku&gt;</code> to just <code>&lt;sku&gt;</code> (we could
blame it on inconsistency in data, where SKUs used as keys have been turned
into keywords but not those used as values).</li>
</ol>

<p>Due to the use of nil as widely acceptable Null Object and the fact that many
functions work on different types of inputs, mistakes in Clojure can travel far
and manifestate at unexpected ways and places. That is a problem for people like
me how aren't good at maintaining a correct mental model of the data as it is
being transformed.</p>
<p>The problem could be mitigated by providing more visibility and displaying the
data produced by each expression and making it possible to explore it interactively
(as you can with a <code>console.log</code>-ed object in a browser's Console). It could be
also mitigated by expressing you expectations about the shape of data and letting
the computer verify regularly that they hold, using <code>core.typed</code> or pre- and
post-conditions, Prismatic Schema etc.</p>
