The first <a href="https://www.code-conf.com/osl15/" target="_blank">Continuous Delivery and DevOps Conference</a> in Oslo is over. It was nice to see so many people interested in the topic. I would have preferred more practical talks of the "how we did it" type over the "why" type but it was OK, though next year I would prefer flatMap. Here are my highlights:<br><br><ul>
    <li>Atmel is using a physical robot to plug and connect a particular configuration of circuit boards to test; your automated testing challenges cannot be greater than theirs!</li>
    <li>Continuous Delivery <a href="https://twitter.com/Juergen_Muench/status/593323622934171648">decreases the risk</a> of outage and time-to-recovery while enabling faster innovation, correlates with higher profits; <a href="https://twitter.com/sebrose/status/593419976784097282">No efficiency improvement will outperform cycle time reduction</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://twitter.com/HolyJak/status/593402032553328642">Estimation pathologies</a>; focus on value rather than costs</li>
    <li>Stop talking about requirements, they are fake; they're just beliefs about what may add value to customers. Use hypothesis instead!</li>
    <li>Cisco: Most of the tools increasing productivity (and some innovation) were produced by engineers in their "spare" time; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Slack-Getting-Burnout-Busywork-Efficiency/dp/0932633617/">slack time</a> is thus crucial</li>
    <li>How does Cisco grow professionalism : optimise for the 10% best, not the 10% weakest developers; slack time; make everything visible; encourage code reviews but avoid making them mandatory; <a href="https://twitter.com/HolyJak/status/593422453575163904">see the slide</a></li>
    <li>CALMS: Culture, Automation, Lean, Measurement, Sharing. The pillars of devOps</li>
    <li>Cisco invested a lot in crafting their build system, tailored test frameworks, and emulators to be able to get quick and quality feedback - because it pays off
<ul>
    <li>“Make you own build system” says @olvemaudal at @CoDeOSL. IME this is inevitable for non-trivial projects, and a good investment.</li>
</ul>

    <li><a href="https://github.com/finn-no/unleash/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">Unleash: Feature Toggles</a> server and Java/Node client by FINN.no</li>
    <li>"They asked for a report while they actually need just a list of data, the result of a simple SQL query; have we listened to them, we would have wasted hours creating a report in the report framework with logos and all the crap."</li>
