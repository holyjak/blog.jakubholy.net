Mounting an EBS volume to a Docker instance running on Amazon Elastic Beanstalk (EB) is surprisingly tricky. The good news is that it is possible.<br><br>I will describe how to automatically create and mount a new EBS volume (optionally based on a snapshot). If you would prefer to mount a specific, existing EBS volume, you should check out <a href="https://github.com/leg100/docker-ebs-attach">leg100's docker-ebs-attach</a> (using AWS API to mount the volume) that you can use either in a multi-container setup or just include the relevant parts in your own Dockerfile.<br><br>The problem with EBS volumes is that, if I am correct, a volume can only be mounted to a single EC2 instance - and thus doesn't play well with EB's autoscaling. That is why EB supports only creating and mounting a fresh volume for each instance.<br><br><!--more--><br><br>Why would you want to use an auto-created EBS volume? You can already use a docker VOLUME to mount a directory on the host system's ephemeral storage to make data persistent across docker restarts/redeploys. The only advantage of EBS is that it survives restarts of the EC2 instance but that is something that, I suppose, happens rarely. I suspect that in most cases EB actually creates a new EC2 instance and then destroys the old one. One possible benefit of an EBS volume is that you can take a snapshot of it and use that to launch future instances. I'm now inclined to believe that a better solution in most cases is to set up automatic backup to and restore from S3, f.ex. using <a href="https://duplicity.nongnu.org/">duplicity</a> with its S3 backend (<a href="/2015/04/03/backup-wd-mycloud-to-s3glacier-with-duplicity-build-instructions-included/">as I do for my NAS</a>).<br><br>Anyway, here is how I got EBS volume mounting working. There are 4 parts to the solution:<br><br><ol>
    <li>Configure EB to create an EBS mount for your instances</li>
    <li>Add custom EB commands to format and mount the volume upon first use</li>
    <li>Restart the Docker daemon after the volume is mounted so that it will see it (<a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=625243">see this discussion</a>)</li>
    <li>Configure Docker to mount the (mounted) volume inside the container</li>
</ol><br><br>1-3.: .ebextensions/01-ebs.config:<br><br><pre><code>
# .ebextensions/01-ebs.config
commands:
  01format-volume:
    command: mkfs -t ext3 /dev/sdh
    test: file -sL /dev/sdh | grep -v 'ext3 filesystem'
    # ^ prints '/dev/sdh: data' if not formatted
  02attach-volume:
    ### Note: The volume may be renamed by the Kernel, e.g. sdh -&gt; xvdh but
    #       /dev/ will then contain a symlink from the old to the new name
    command: |
      mkdir /media/ebs_volume
      mount /dev/sdh /media/ebs_volume
      service docker restart # We must restart Docker daemon or it wont' see the new mount
    test: sh -c &quot;! grep -qs '/media/ebs_volume' /proc/mounts&quot;
option_settings:
   # Tell EB to create a 100GB volume and mount it to /dev/sdh
   - namespace: aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration
     option_name: BlockDeviceMappings
     value: /dev/sdh=:100
</code></pre><br><br>4.: Dockerrun.aws.json and Dockerfile:<br><br><code>Dockerrun.aws.json</code>: mount the host's <code>/media/ebs_volume</code> as <code>/var/easydeploy/share</code> inside the container:
<pre><code>
{
  &quot;AWSEBDockerrunVersion&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,
  &quot;Volumes&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;HostDirectory&quot;: &quot;/media/ebs_volume&quot;,
      &quot;ContainerDirectory&quot;: &quot;/var/easydeploy/share&quot;
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre><br><br><code>Dockerfile</code>: Tell Docker to use a directory on the host system as <code>/var/easydeploy/share</code> - either a randomly generated one or the one given via the <code>-m</code> mount option to <code>docker run</code>:
<pre><code>
...
VOLUME [&quot;/var/easydeploy/share&quot;]
...
</code></pre>
