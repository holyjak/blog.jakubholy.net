According to the NDC Oslo talk <a href="https://ndcoslo.oktaset.com/t-31341">Lean and Functional Programming</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/bryan_hunter">Bryan Hunter</a>, these are the reasons why companies fail to adopt FP:<br><br><ul>
    <li>They say "our developers aren't smart enough" (to use F#, Erlang) [they should invest in their education!]</li>
    <li>Culture of hiding problems =&gt; little incentive to adopt a paradigm that solves/prevents them if they're invisible</li>
    <li>Overburden =&gt; not time</li>
    <li>Implementing changes (FP) without first proving them (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA">PDCA</a>) - blindly rewriting something in F#/... can fail; it's better to have a value-proposition hypothesis and prove it with a limited experiment first</li>
    <li>The prioritise short-term (e.g. fire-fighting) over long-term (removing the root causes of problems)</li>
</ul><br><br>Tip for driving FP adoption: Find a pragmatist in pain - e.g. a business person experiencing problems that FP could have prevented.
