There is an important difference between running a script manually (<code>ssh machine; machine$ ./script.sh</code>) and running it via ssh (<code>ssh machine &lt; script.sh</code>): in the letter case the connection will not close when the script finishes but will stay open until stdout/stderr are closed or a timeout occurs. In Jenkins it will therefore seem as if the script hangs.<br><br>So if your shell scripts starts any background job, make sure to redirect all its output to somewhere:<br><br><pre><code>
nohup some-background-task &amp;&gt; /dev/null   # No space between &amp; and &gt; !
</code></pre><br><br>This has bitten me when trying to deploy an application from the Jenkins CI using SSH and a shell script.<br><br>References: http://www.snailbook.com/faq/background-jobs.auto.html
