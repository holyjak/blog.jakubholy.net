Philipp Garbe describes how to pass environment variables that you want to keep private to a public Docker instance run on Amazon Web Services (beanstalk or ECS) in his post <a href="https://pgarbe.github.io/blog/2015/07/10/how-to-run-hubot-in-docker-on-aws-ec2-container-services-part-3/">How to Run HuBot in Docker on AWS EC2 Container Services - Part 3</a>. The trick is:<br><br><ol>
    <li>Put them into an <code>env.sh</code> file that you can source on S3 (and allow the appropriate EC2 IAM role to access it)</li>
    <li>As a part of your startup CMD, run <code>aws s3 cp</code> to fetch and then source it</li>
</ol><br><br>Here is his example of the CMD from a Dockerfile:<br><br><pre><code>
CMD [&quot;/bin/sh&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, &quot;aws s3 cp --region eu-west-1 s3://your-bucket/env.sh .; . ./env.sh; bin/hubot --adapter slack&quot;]
</code></pre><br><br>See the <a href="https://github.com/pgarbe/tatsu-hubot">full source code in his GitHub repo</a>. Thanks for sharing, Phillipp!
