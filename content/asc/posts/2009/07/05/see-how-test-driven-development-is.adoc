On the Manning site you can read the 2nd chapter of the book Test Driven - Practical TDD and Acceptance TDD for Java Developers by Lasse Koskela from 2007. The <a href="https://www.manning-source.com/books/koskela/Chapter2Sample.pdf">chapter 2: Beginning TDD</a> let's you follow the mental process of a programmer practicing TDD to implement a set of user stories. You've probably heard a lot about TDD on the theoretical level but this sample chapter gives you the unique opportunity to see the basic, practical level of TDD in action. I'm very glad to have read it.<br><br>The interesting thing is how he really always does the simplest possible solution (read 'dummy and 0% generic') to make the test pass and continuously adds tests and refactors the implementation to get the final code.
