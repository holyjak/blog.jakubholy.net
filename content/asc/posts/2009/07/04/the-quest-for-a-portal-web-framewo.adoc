<p>For a long time I've been looking for a web framework that would ease the development of web UI in portlets. Pure JSP is too old-fashioned and the abstraction it provides is just too low-level. There are many good web frameworks for standard web applications (JSF/Seam, GWT, Struts 2, Wicket, you name it...) but if they include portlet support than only as an after-thought and it's usually far behind the quality and features of the standard web framework. Nobody was able to recommend me a decent portlet web framework - until recently.</p><p>&nbsp;First I've learned about an upcoming book Portlets in Action (<a href="https://www.manning.com/sarin/">preview</a>) by Ashish Sarin, which teaches not only Portlets 2.0 (JSR 286) but also other must-haves for a real world development like a portlet web framework and Ajax (DWR in this case). You've surely already guessed that Ashish uses Spring Portlet MVC, which indicates that it must be indeed good.</p><p>Than I've been surprised to learn that my good and trustworthy collegue, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladimirschreiner">Vlado</a>, is using Spring Portlet MVC on his project. He had but positive words about the framework: &quot;<i>It's excellent, I wouldn't make portlets with anything else. It's enough lightweight, it helps where it should and doesn't limit you anyhow.</i>&quot;</p><p>The only issue is that the current stable release doesn't support JSR286 yet (events, resource serving...). Fortunately the upcoming release of Spring 3.0 will support it. Spring 3.0 <a href="https://blog.springsource.com/2009/05/06/spring-framework-30-m3-released/">M3 have been released in May</a> 2009 (more <a href="https://blog.springsource.com/2009/02/25/spring-framework-30-m2-released/">about Portlet 2.0 support</a> on M2 release page), RC1 should have been released in June. You can learn about details in the <a href="https://jira.springframework.org/browse/SPR-4259">corresponding Jira issue</a>.</p><p><b>Update 2/2010</b>:&nbsp; Liferay uses quite a lot Struts to build its portlets, for instance when developing a portlet as an EXT plugin (not recommanded), you can only use Struts, so Struts is surely a viable alternative. There is a <a href="https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/3409471?_19_threadView=flat">discussion of Spring vs. Struts</a> at Liferay forums (6/2009).<br /></p><h4>Resources</h4><ul><li>Liferay wiki:<br /></li><ul><li><a href="https://www.liferay.com/web/guest/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Spring-Hibernate-DWR">Spring-Hibernate-DWR</a> - Integrating Spring MVC Portlet 3.0 M2, Hibernate 3.3.1 GA, DWR 3 RC1 and Liferay 5.2.2</li><li><a href="https://www.liferay.com/web/guest/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Sample+Spring+Portlet">Sample Spring Portlet</a> <br /></li></ul></ul>
