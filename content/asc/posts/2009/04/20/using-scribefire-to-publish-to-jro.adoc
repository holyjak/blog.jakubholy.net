<p>To get the Firefox extension ScribeFire (v.3.2.3) to publish to jroller.com you may set you account as follows:</p><ol><li>Address of you blog: e.g. http://jroller.com/page/holy</li><li>Blog system: MetaWeblog API (though there is also en experimental support of Roller)</li><ul><li>Of course you must first allow the MetaWeblog API in your blog's settings<br /></li></ul><li>URL of API server: http://www.jroller.com/roller-services/xmlrpc <br /></li><li>The username and password you use to log in to JRoller.</li></ol>I wish this was documented somewhere in the official JRoller documentation (is there any?!) so that I wouldn't need to aste my time trying to figure it out.<br /><br />Actually using ScribeFire 3.2.3 may not be such a good idea after all. I've just found it has some nasty problems with not escaping and un-escaping &lt; and &gt; (at least inside &lt;pre&gt;) and doesn't really understand that &lt;p&gt; should be closed when a &lt;h2&gt; is created :-(<br />
