<h4>Problem <br /></h4><p>When deploying JSF 1.1 application to WebSphere 6.0 I got the following not much helpful exception: <br />
</p><pre>java.lang.NullPointerException<br />        at javax.faces.webapp.FacesServlet.init(FacesServlet.java:144)</pre><p>Checking SystemErr.log revealed the following explanation: <br /></p><pre>javax.faces.FacesException: Can't parse configuration file:file:/usr/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/profileNode1/installedApps/<br />a25ciwas005Network/jholy-GroovyConsole_temp.ear/GroovyConsole.war/WEB-INF/faces-config.xml<br />...<br />Caused by: java.net.SocketException: Connection timed out:could be due to invalid address</pre>
<p>The explanation is that the XML parser cannot access http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-facesconfig_1_1.dtd referenced from the config file, presumabely due to firewall setup.</p><p>I should say that I've&nbsp; jsf-api.jar and jsf-impl.jar in the webapp.<br /></p><h4>Solution</h4><p>The solution is either to provide the DTD locally or perhaps to remove the &lt;!DOCTYPE ..&gt; declaration from the file. I've </p><p>1. downloaded the dtd and put it to WEB-INF/web-facesconfig_1_1.dtd and </p><p>2. modified the doctype declaration as follows:</p><p>
</p><pre><span class="doctype">&lt;!DOCTYPE faces-config SYSTEM &quot;web-facesconfig_1_1.dtd&quot;&gt;</span></pre><p>Voila, few hours of wasted time and problem is solved. I wish the responsible developer has thought a bit more.</p>
