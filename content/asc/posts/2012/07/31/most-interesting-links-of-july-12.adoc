A brief one due to (thanks to?) holiday and an accompanying surprising lack of enthusiasm for the technical stuff.
<h2>Recommended Readings</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://blog.borud.no/2010/11/microdesign-and-red-flags.html">Microdesign and red flags</a> - why using an "else" or returning a boolean as a success indicator should rise a red flag and make you think what you're trying to achieve and whether there aren't better options (often there are - using guard conditions instead of else and throwing an exception or returning a detailed status object instead of a boolean)</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-eaed19/index.html">Evolutionary architecture and emergent design: Emergent design in the wild</a> - the final article in Neal Ford's highly interesting<a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/views/java/libraryview.jsp?search_by=evolutionary+architecture+emergent+design:"> series on emergent design</a>, discussing how to recognize the "last responsible moment," the problems with big up-front designs due to "unknown unknowns" etc., highly recommended</li>

<h2>Useful Tools</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/">Capistrano</a> - Ruby ops tool usable to execute shell commands on multiple servers via SSH (originally intended for deployment of RoR apps). Cap shell enables execution of commands on all/selected servers interactively.
Quick start: gem install capistrano; echo "role :all, srv1.example.com, srv2,example.com" &gt; Capfile; cap invoke COMMAND="hostname" SUDO=1; cap shell
