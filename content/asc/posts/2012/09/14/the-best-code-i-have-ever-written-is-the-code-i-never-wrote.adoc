The best code I have ever written is the code I never wrote. It works exactly as intended. There are no bugs, ever. It doesn't increase complexity of the application. Other people don't need to struggle to understand it. It gets never outdated.<br><br>Therefore don't write code unless you really have to.<br><br><p style="text-align:center;"><em>You might enjoy also other <a href="/tag/opinion/">posts on effective development</a>.</em></p>
