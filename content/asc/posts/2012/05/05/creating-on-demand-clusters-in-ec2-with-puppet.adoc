For a recent project I needed to be able to start on-demand clusters of machines in Amazon EC2. We needed each instance in a cluster to allow SSH and sudo access for all team members and to install and configure the software appropriate for that cluster ("database" node or "testclient" node).<br><br>You can see the results of my effort using EC2 command-line tools, Puppet etc. at <a href="https://github.com/iterate/codecamp2012/tree/puppet">the project's Puppet GitHub repository</a>, the setup is described in detail in its <a href="https://github.com/iterate/codecamp2012/blob/puppet/README.md">README</a>.<br><br>(Tips for improvements are welcome. And not, <a href="https://web.mit.edu/star/cluster/">Star Cluster</a> isn't what we needed.)
