Some guy from <a href="https://www.ucertify.com/">uCertify</a>, which offers preparation kits for various programming exams in Java and other areas, asked me to review their PrepKit service. I hadn't really the time to do so but I'm sure it's awsome,Â  and it even work on Macs. So if you want to prepare for an exam, you might consider them.<br><br>I'm very thankful for them for teaching me to never promise anything I'm not really commited to do.
