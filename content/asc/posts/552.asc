We need to somehow analyse statistical data about the performance of our batch job to understand its behavior in time and bottlenecks. The metrics include total run time, number of processed records and total/mean/std. deviation of execution time of various components of the job such as LDAP queries and web service call. We'd like to know how "stable" these metrics are, i.e. if there is large or small variation in the speed of the job/external systems, and what the average characteristics - and their variations - are. I've decided to use OpenOffice.org Calc to analyse the data, namely to compute the group characteristics (mean, deviation etc.) and to plot the data to get an easy to understand overview of the data. I'd also like the view of the data to be interactive, i.e. to change based on some choices regarding the input data, such as whether to include extreme values or custom, non-scheduled run of the job. This blogs describes what I've done and few neat Calc tricks I've learned.<br><br><!--more--><br><br>Disclaimer: I'm not a Calc guru and I've already forgotten most I've learned about statistics at the unviversity, therefore my use of them may be flawed. Improvement suggestions are warmly welcomed.<br><br>I'm using Calc 3.2 under Ubuntu 10.04.
<h2>Side note about localization</h2>
I believe that OOo Calc uses different special characters based on your local. For me the following apply:
<ul>
	<li>function parameters are separated with a comma (,)</li>
	<li>text is enclosed with double quotes ("...")</li>
	<li>I use decimal dot (11/10 = 1.1)</li>
</ul>
Check what works for you.
<h2>My performance data analysis</h2>
See the next part, Calc functions and features used in the analysis, for detailed instructions regarding the individual Calc features used in the analysis.
<h3>Generating frequency table for plotting distribution based on percentiles</h3>
Lets suppose that you have a range of numbers in A1:A30 and that the range is named 'data'. You want to see their distribution.<br><br>To plot a distribution graph in Calc you need to assign the (likely continous) input values into a limited number of discrete groups (categories). For example for time you could define a category for each hour (0-1h, 1-2h, .., 22-23h). In other words, you need to create a <strong>frequency table</strong> with some N categories:
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Range upper limit</th>
<th># values in the range</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Range 1 top</td>
<td># values between 0 and this value</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2">...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Range N-1 top</td>
<td># values between (Range N-2 top) and (Range N-1 top)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-</td>
<td># values above (Range N-1 top)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
However you don't want to define the limits of categories manually because you aren't sure how large numbers there can be in the input. Also, you don't want extremely low/high but rare values to distort the view of the normal and common values.<br><br>We will therefore <strong>define 10 categories dynamically</strong> using the 5% and 95% percentiles for the first and last category, dividing the range between them equally.
<ul>
	<li>A "10% percentile" is such a value, that 10% of the input data is less  or equal to it. It approximately means that it is the 10th smallest  value.</li>
</ul>
One of the advantages of this solution is that the extreme values, which tend to be little frequent, will be in the 5% percentile and between the 95% and 100% percentile, i.e. in the first and last categories, and we can thus easily exclude them to get less distorted view.<br><br>To compute the actual frequencies from the input data and the defined ranges we will use the FREQUENCY array function.<br><br>The frequency table will be:
<ul>
	<li>the first column with "range tops" will be used to create the named range "data_ranges"</li>
	<li>lets suppose that the cell $B$28 contains the "inner range step" computed as ((first range - last range)/8), i.e. (PERCENTILE(data,0.95)-PERCENTILE(data,0.05))/8</li>
	<li>the INDEX(range,row,column) function returns, in this case, the first range, i.e. the 5% percentile</li>
</ul>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Range tops</th>
<th>Frequencies</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>=PERCENTILE(data,0.05)</td>
<td>{=FREQUENCY(data, data_ranges)}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>=1* $B$28*1+INDEX(data_ranges,1,1)</td>
<td>(a frequency produced by the FREQ. function)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>=2* $B$28*1+INDEX(data_ranges,1,1)</td>
<td>(a frequency produced by the FREQ. function)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>=3* $B$28*1+INDEX(data_ranges,1,1)</td>
<td>(a frequency produced by the FREQ. function)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>=4* $B$28*1+INDEX(data_ranges,1,1)</td>
<td>(a frequency produced by the FREQ. function)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>=5* $B$28*1+INDEX(data_ranges,1,1)</td>
<td>(a frequency produced by the FREQ. function)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>=6* $B$28*1+INDEX(data_ranges,1,1)</td>
<td>(a frequency produced by the FREQ. function)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>=7* $B$28*1+INDEX(data_ranges,1,1)</td>
<td>(a frequency produced by the FREQ. function)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>=PERCENTILE(data,0.95)</td>
<td>(a frequency produced by the FREQ. function)</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>(a frequency produced by the FREQ. function)</td>

It may be a good idea to use relative frequencies instead of the actual ones (FREQUENCY(..)/COUNT(data)).
<h2>Calc functions and features used in the analysis</h2>
<h3>Naming fields/ranges for readability and maintainability</h3>
You can assign a name to a cell or a range of cells and use that name instead of the cell name (such as A1) or range (such as A1:A26). The names are unique within the spreadsheet and thus don't need to be prefixed with sheet name.
<h4>Naming a range</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Select cells</li>
	<li>Insert - Names - Define, type a name, e.g. "my range"</li>
	<li>To select the whole range, select its cell and press Ctrl+\ You will then see its name in the position field (next to the formula bar).</li>
</ul>
Using the range in a function - simply type its name (without the sheet name), ex.: "=PERCENTILE(my range, 0.1)"
<h4>Naming a cell</h4>
<ul>
	<li>as naming a range but select just a single cell; can be used in functions as well</li>
	<li>when you click on the cell, you should see its name in the name field inst. of the old &lt;letter&gt;&lt;number&gt;</li>
</ul>
<h4>Limitations of the named ranges/cells</h4>
It seems that as of Calc 3.2.0, you can't use the names everywhere, for example when declaring a data range for a chart or a linked cell for a form control.
<h3>Array formulas and functions (for applying an operation to a range of cells)</h3>
Into a cell you can insert a formula that operates on an array of cells and also produces an array, instead of doing the operation for each cell separately. For example, if you have numbers in A1:A10 and want to have them divided by 10 in the row below then you can - instead of entering "=A1/10" into B1 etc. - enter "=A1:A10/10" into B1 and the whole row B1:B10 is generated. Individual cells of the result are then locked against changes.<br><br>BEWARE: For the formula to be truly an array formula, when <strong>creating it</strong>, <em>you must either press Control+Shift+Enter</em> instead of Enter if typing it manually <em>or check "Array"</em> (left-bottom corner) if using the Function Wizard. An array formula is denoted by braces ("{=A1:A10/10}") but you can't type them manually, you must use either C+S+Enter or the Array check-box.<br><br>Array formulas may contain also array functions such as the FREQUENCY function, taking data row and a list of upper limits and producing a table of frequencies of the data values in the individual categories.<br><br><strong>To modify</strong> an array formula you must select all its cells otherwise Calc will warn you that "You cannot change only part of an array.".
<h3>Useful techniques</h3>
<h4>Ignore/include a cell by switching between blank/value based on dynamic criteria</h4>
I find it useful to be able to dynamically decide what data should or shouldn't go into a computation (such as including all data or only those in a particular range). The only way I've found so far to do it is to create a derived data range where data is replaced with a blank when it should be excluded and using functions and formulas that ignore such fields. Unfortunatelly it doesn't work everywhere, for example I don't know how to make charts ignore blank values.<br><br>To switch between blank/value you would use the IF function: IF(test, input cell, ""). You can build more complex expressions with the other logical functions.<br><br>Some functions that ignore blanks (which is what we want):
<ul>
	<li>AVG</li>
	<li>SUMIF(test&amp;data range, condition) - blank cells are ignored; the condition is either a number, tested for equality, or a text expression such as "&gt;3.1". There is also a 3-parameters version, where the test and data ranges may be different.</li>
</ul>
Where blanks aren't ingored:
<ul>
	<li>Chart data ranges (you can select to either assume 0 or display a gap in the chart but not to ignore it)
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://user.services.openoffice.org/en/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=13797">Work-around</a>: Read the data from a "database" with "select X from ... where X is not null". You can also <a href="https://user.services.openoffice.org/en/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=13778&amp;p=64604#p64604">turn the spreadsheet  into a pseudo-database</a> to do the trick (defined named DB ranges, File-New-Database, Connect to existing - spreadsheet).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Example</h5>
Let's suppose that you have
<ul>
	<li>Measured heights of people in A1:A10</li>
	<li>The sex of the people in B1:B10 ('M' or 'F')</li>
	<li>A cell named "female_only", which contains either TRUE or FALSE (a boolean, not a string)</li>
</ul>
In C1:C10 you want to have either all or only female heights based on the value of "female_only". You will therefore type the following into C1 and copy it to C2 - C10:<br><br><pre><code><br><br>=IF(AND(female_only,B1=&quot;M&quot;),&quot;&quot;, A1)<br><br></code></pre><br><br>If the condition is true then the content of the cell will be "", i.e. it will be blank.
<h5>Alternatives</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Somebody proposes to <a href="https://user.services.openoffice.org/en/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=13797#p64920">use the function NA()</a> (not available) instead of blanks, though it also seems to have some issues.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Creating an interactive view with form elements (check boxes etc.)</h3>
You can add form elements such as check boxes to a Calc spreadsheet to make it easy for the reader to easily control the data. The form elements usually retrieve input from some cells and output something into a cell, based on their state. You could simply change data in the cells manually but the controls make it more comfortable to use.
<h4>Adding a check box for enabling/disabling filtering criteria</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Show the form controls toolbar: View - Toolbars - Form controls</li>
	<li>Use the Form controls toolbar to switch to the design mode (the icon an [OK] button and a hand)</li>
	<li>Click on the check box icon and place it somewhere into the sheet (by drawing a rectangle)</li>
	<li>Right-click it and select Control... from the pop-up menu</li>
	<li>Click the Data tab</li>
	<li>Enter a cell name (e.g. B1) into the Linked Cell (do not fill the Reference value fields)</li>
	<li>Switch off the design mode; now clicking the check box will insert TRUE or FALSE (a boolean value) into the linked cell</li>
</ol>
<h4>Adding a list box for selecting from a predefined list on entries</h4>
This is similar to inserting a checkbox, only we will define a static list of values that can be selected. This is done on the first tab of the control's configuration page in the List Entries entry - use Shift+Enter to separate individual values.<br><br>For detailed instructions see page 3 in [FIND].
