	<li><a href="https://blogs.hbr.org/2012/09/want-to-build-resilience-kill-the-complexity/">HBR: Want to Build Resilience? Kill the Complexity</a> - a highly interesting, thought provoking article relevant both to technology in particular and the society in general; f.ex.: more security features are bad for they make us behave less safely (risk compensation) and are more fragile w.r.t. unexpected events. "<em>Complexity is a clear and present danger to both firms and the global financial system: it makes both much harder to manage, govern, audit, regulate and support effectively in times of crisis. [..] Combine complex, Robust-Yet-Fragile systems, risk-compensating human psyches, and risk-homeostatic organizational cultures, and you inevitably get catastrophes of all kinds: meltdowns, economic crises, and the like.</em>" The solution to future financial crisis is primarily not more regulation but <strong>simplification of the system</strong> - to make it easier to police, tougher to game. We also need to <strong>decrease interconnectednes</strong> (of banks etc.), one of the primary sources of complexity. Also a great example of US Army combatting complex, high-risk situations by employing "devil's advocates / <strong>professional skeptics</strong>" trained to help "<em>avoid the perils of overconfidence, strategic brittleness, and groupthink. The goal is to respectfully help leaders in complex situations unearth untested assumptions, consider alternative interpretations and “think like the other”</em>".</li>
	<li><a href="https://edgeperspectives.typepad.com/edge_perspectives/2013/12/the-dark-side-of-technology.html">The Dark Side of Technology</a> - technologies provide great opportunities - but also risks we should be aware of - they create a world of mounting performance pressure for all of us (individuals, companies, states), accelerate the rate of change, increasing uncertanity (=&gt; risk of Taleb's black swans). "<em>All of this mounting pressure has an understandable but very dangerous consequence. It draws out and intensifies certain cognitive biases [..]</em>" - magnify our perception of risk, shrink our time horizons, foster a more and more reactive approach to the world, the "if you win, I will lose" view, erode our ability to trust anyone - and "<em>combined effect of these cognitive biases increases the temptation to use these new digital infrastructures in a dysfunctional way: surveillance and control in all aspects of our economic, social and political life.</em>" =&gt; "<em>significantly increase[d] the likelihood of an economic, social and political backlash, driven by an unholy alliance between those who have power today and those who have achieved some modest degree of income and success.</em>"
Complexity theory: the more connected a system is, the more vulnerable it becomes to cascades of disruptive information/action.</li>

France recently passed a law that requires Uber etc. drivers to wait 15 min before picking up a customer so that established taxi services have it easier; wot?!)</li>

[...] Hopefully this gives fans of the current crop of JS MVCs and even people who believe in just using plain JavaScript and jQuery some food for thought. I've shown that a compile to JavaScript language that uses slower data structures ends up faster than a reasonably fast competitor for rich user interfaces. To top it off Om TodoMVC with the same bells and whistles as everyone else weighs in at ~260 lines of code</em>"</li>

Facebook's <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> JavaScript framework  is a fresh and innovative challenger in the MVC field. It is worthwile to learn why they parted ways with the popular approach of templates (spoiler: concern separation, cohesion x coupling, performance). Their approach with virtual DOM enables some cool things (run in Node, provide HTML5-like events in any browser with consistent behavior, ...). Key: templates are actually tightly coupled to display logic (controllers) via the model view tailored for them (i.e. Controller must know what specific data &amp; in what form View needs) =&gt; follow cohesion and keep them together componets, separate from other components and back-end code. Also, state changing over time at many places is hard =&gt; re-render the whole app rather than in-place updates. Also, the <a href="https://github.com/swannodette/om/blob/master/README.md">ClojureScript Om wrapper</a> enables even more performance optimizations thanks to immutable data structures etc.</li>
