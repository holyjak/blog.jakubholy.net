A short story about the complexity of magical frameworks and dependency injection with a happy ending, featuring Resteasy, CDI, and JBoss.<br><br>Once upon time, I have created a JAX-RS webservice that needed to supply data to a user's session. I wanted to be fancy and thus created a <code>@Singleton</code> class for the exchange of information between the two (since only a user request serving code can legally access her session, a global data exchange is needed). However sharing the singleton between the REST service and JSF handler wasn't so easy:
<ul>
	<li>Originally, the singleton was generic: <code>OneTimeMailbox&lt;T&gt;</code> - but this is not supported by CDI so I had to create a derived class (annotated with <code>@Named @Singleton</code>)</li>
	<li>While everything worked in my Arquillian test, at runtime I got NullPointerException because the <code>@Inject</code>-ed mailbox was null in the service, for reasons unclear. According to the internets, <a href="https://michalostruszka.pl/blog/2012/10/31/resteasy-cdi-integration/">CDI and JAX-RS do not blend well</a> unless you use ugly tricks such as annotating your service with <code>@RequestScoped</code> (didn't help me) or use JBoss' <a href="https://community.jboss.org/wiki/RESTEasy-CDIIntegration">resteasy-cdi</a> module.</li>
</ul>
Finally I got fed up by all the complexity standing in my way and reverted to plain old Java singleton (<code>OneTimeMailbox.getInstance()</code>) while making testing possible with multiple instances by having <del>a setter</del><ins> an alternative constructor</ins> taking the mailbox on each class using it (the service and JSF bean) (using a constructor might be even better).<br><br>Result? Actually better testability and simpler code.<br><br>Bjørn Borud and Johannes Brodwall were right - <a href="https://blog.borud.no/2013/03/gorging-on-java-frameworks-and.html">plain old Java is better than magical frameworks</a> and <a href="https://johannesbrodwall.com/2010/11/10/this-dependency-injection-madness-must-end/">magical DI is evil</a>. (Though they would diapprove of JBoss and likely prefered if I used a plain servlet instead of JAX-RS for my very simple case.)<br><br><strong>Update</strong>: As <a href="https://twitter.com/kolman/status/405745218768486400">pointed out by Daniel Kolman</a> now and others previously, dependency injection itself isn't bad (<a href="https://twitter.com/bodil/status/405748891691548672">though some would argue</a>), it is only magic DI that is a problem. You can well do DI yourself using plain old Java - see <a href="https://comoyo.github.io/blog/2013/02/06/the-inverse-of-ioc-is-control/">Bakksjø: The inverse of IoC is Control</a>, <a href="https://blacksheep.parry.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/DIY-DI.pdf">Perry: Do-It-Yourself Dependency Injection</a> (pdf; quote: "<em>[..] shows how dependency injection can be </em><em>accomplished without any framework. The same benefits provided by frameworks can be realized using </em><em>“do-it-yourself” (DIY) handcrafted code.</em>"; <a href="https://misko.hevery.com/2010/05/26/do-it-yourself-dependency-injection/">recommended by</a> Google's test master Miško Hevery who is a fan of DI because it helps with testability).
