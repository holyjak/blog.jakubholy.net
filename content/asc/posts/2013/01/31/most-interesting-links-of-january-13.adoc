Kernighan's "Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.

Ford explains the advantages of FP and why FP concepts are spreading into other languages (higher abstractions enabling focus on the results over steps and ceding control to the language, more reusability on a finer level (higher-order functions etc.), few generic data structures with many operations -&gt; better composability, "new" and different tool such as lazy collections, shaping the language towards the problem instead of vice versa, aligning with trends such as immutability)</li>

</ul>
SW development
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://server.dzone.com/articles/how-completely-fail-bdd">How to Completely Fail at BDD</a> - a story of an enthusiastic developer who tried to make everyone's life better by introducing automated BDD tests and failed due to differences in culture (and inability to change thinking from the traditional testing), a surprising lack of interest in the tool and learning how to write good tests: "Culturally, my current team just isn’t ready or interested in something like this." Morale: It is hard to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Switch-Change-Things-When-Hard/dp/0385528752/">change people</a>, good ideas are not enough.</li>
	<li><a href="https://michaelfeathers.typepad.com/michael_feathers_blog/2013/01/refactoring-is-sloppy.html">M. Feathers: Refactoring is Sloppy</a> - refactoring is often prioritized out of regular development and refactoring sprints/stories aren't popular due to past failures etc. An counter-intuitive way to get refactoring in is to imagine, during planning, what the code would need to be like to make it easy to implement a story. Then create a task for making it so before the story itself and assign it to somebody else then the story (to force a degree of scrutiny and communication). "Like anything else in process, this is medicine.  It's not meant to be 'the way that people do things for all time' [..]" - i.e. intended for use when you can't fit refactoring in otherwise. It may also make the cost of the current bad code more visible. Read also the commits (f.ex. the mikado method case).</li>
	<li><a href="https://cyber-dojo.com/">Cyber-dojo</a>: A great way to practice TDD together. Compare your read-green cycle and development over time with other teams. Purposefully minimalistic editor, a number of prepared tdd tasks.</li>
	<li><a href="https://java.dzone.com/articles/dark-side-craftsmanship">On the Dark Side of "Craftsmanship"</a> - an interesting and provoking article. Some developers, the software labouers, want to get work done and go home, they haven't the motivation and energy to continualy spend time improving themselves. There is nothing wrong with that and we shouldn't disparge them because of that. We shouldn't divide people into craftsmen and the bad ones. A summary of and response to the varied reactions follows up in <a href="https://agile.dzone.com/articles/more-craftsmanship">More on "Craftsmanship"</a>. The author is right that we can't expect everybody to spend nights improving her/his programming skills. Still they should not produce code of poor quality (with few exceptions) since maintaining such code costs a lot. There should be time for enough quality in a 9-5 day and people should be provided with enough guidance and education to be able to write decent code. (Though I'm not sure how feasible it is, how much effort it takes to become an acceptable developer.) Does the increased cost of writing (an learning to write) good code overweight the cost of working with bad code? That is an eternal discussion.</li>
</ul>
Cloud, web, big data etc.
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://mcfunley.com/whom-the-gods-would-destroy-they-first-give-real-time-analytics">Whom the Gods Would Destroy, They First Give Real-time Analytics</a> (via <a href="https://leonomics.com/">Leon</a>) - a very reasonable argument against real-time analytics: yes, we want real-time operational metrics but "analytics" only makes sense on a sensible amount of data (for the sake of statistical significance etc.) RT analytics could easily provide misguided results.
<a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/cap-twelve-years-later-how-the-rules-have-changed">CAP Twelve Years Later: How the "Rules" Have Changed</a> (tl;dr, via <a href="https://twitter.com/_dagi">@_dagi</a>) - an in-depth discussion of the CAP theorem and the simplification (2 out of 3) that it makes; there are many more nuances. By Eric Brewer, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, and vice president of infrastructure at Google.</li>
	<li><a href="https://roca-style.org/">ROCA: Resource-oriented Client Architecture</a> - "A collection of simple recommendations for decent Web application frontends." Server-side: true REST, no session state, working back/refresh etc. Client: semantic HTML independent of layout, progressive enhancement (usable with older browsers), usable without JS (all logic on the server) etc. Certainly not suitable for all types of apps but worthwile to consider the principles and compare them with your needs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Clojure Corner</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://martinsprogrammingblog.blogspot.no/2012/05/distributed-actors-in-clojure.html">Distributed Actors in Clojure</a> (5/2012) - a discussion of options for Akka-like stuff in Clojure. Akka is great but "<a href="https://blog.darevay.com/2011/06/clojure-and-akka-a-match-made-in/">interfacing to Akka from Clojure is not nice</a>, and certainly not idiomatic". Though there have been some new Akka-Clojure libs since that (<a href="https://github.com/jasongustafson/akka-clojure">akka-clojure</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gaverhae/okku">okku</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://vaurien.readthedocs.org/en/1.5/">Vaurien, the Chaos TCP Proxy</a> (via <a href="https://twitter.com/bsvingen">@bsvingen</a>) - an extensible proxy that you can control from your tests to simulate network failure or problems such as delays on 20% of the requests; great for testing how an application behaves when facing failures or difficulties with its dependencies. It supports the protocols tcp, http, redis, memcache.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/wvanbergen/request-log-analyzer#readme">Wvanbergen's request-log-analyzer</a> for Apache, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Rails and more (via Zarko) - generates a performance report from a supported access log to point out requests that might need optimizing</li>
	<li><a href="https://teohm.github.com/blog/2012/03/22/working-effectively-with-iterm2/">Working Effectively With iTerm2</a> (Mac) - good tips in the body and comments</li>
</ul>
<h2>Favorite Quotes</h2>
A very good (though not very scientific) definition of project success applicable for distinguishing truly agile from process-driven projects:
<blockquote>[..] a project is successful if:
<ul>
	<li>Something was delivered and put to use</li>
	<li>The project members, sponsors and users are basically happy with the outcome of the project</li>
</ul>
<em>- Johannes Brodwall in <a href="https://www.programutvikling.no/userfiles/brosjyre.pdf">"How do we become Agile?" and why it doesn't matter</a>, inspired by Alistair Cockburn
</em></blockquote>
(Notice there isn't a single word about being "on time and budget".)
