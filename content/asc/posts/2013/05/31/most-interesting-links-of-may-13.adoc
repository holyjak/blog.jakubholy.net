Agile
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/13/05/25/139218/worlds-biggest-agile-software-project-close-to-failure">Discussion: World's Biggest 'Agile' Software Project Close To Failure</a> - what is/isn't agile, agile vs. waterfall etc; a nice collection of all the possible opinions and misunderstandings. Some of my favorites: <a href="https://news.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=3785177&amp;cid=43822773">waste</a>: '<em>[..]An "agile" project cannot fail and cost Billions because it must always deliver runnable software with a maximum of a few weeks delay</em>[..]' (runnable = delivering value), <a href="https://news.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=3785177&amp;cid=43822535">separation</a>: '<em>[..] my experience has been that separating the designer/architect role from the developer role is fraught with pitfalls. The people writing the code should be the ones designing it, [..]</em>', <a href="https://news.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=3785177&amp;cid=43821273">stability</a>: '<em>[..] On the successful projects that I've worked with in Agile, there's strong stakeholders, good architecture keeping the vision in place and project management that keeps things well orchestrated. Without those in the mix, it'll fail just like all software projects. [..]</em>', <a href="https://news.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=3785177&amp;cid=43822061">waterfall success</a>, <a href="https://news.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=3785177&amp;cid=43822585">people issue</a>: '<em><em></em>The problem here isn't waterfall/agile. The problem here isn't .Net/Linux. The problem here is the parties involved. [politicians and IT dinosaurs]</em>' (learn what's needed from drunk, bitching employees; ignore official nonsense requirements),: <a href="https://news.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=3785177&amp;cid=43826395">simplicity</a> '<em>[..] It would probably be a lot easier if they started by making a simpler tool - instead of trying to calculate everybody's entitlements everywhere [..]</em>', <a href="https://news.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=3785177&amp;cid=43825093">agile suitability</a>: '<em>[..] You cannot use Agile to build a 100-mile canal, as the whole thing would be useless even if you completed 99 miles. [..]</em>'.
Some people seem to believe that agile means no architecture and no/too little planning. Some believe that agile = hack now, fix later.</li>

Startups etc.
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://adii.me/scaleability-on-day-1">Why do we worry about scaleability on Day 1?</a> (via @simenfur) -  you can fake/do many things manually to get started to validate your service and eventually to provide it to real, paying customers without lot of features/automation that you might believe to be essential; many real-world examples of this. <a href="https://42floors.com/blog/manual-scaling">Quoting 42Floors</a>: “In fact, when you look at each aspect of our operations, you will find a fairly sophisticated manual operations process predating every piece of technology that we’ve built.” Buffer <a href="https://joel.is/post/46894258442/5-things-that-seem-essential-that-we-launched-buffer">launched a business without 5 seemingly essential ingredients</a>, f.ex. upgrade from a free to paid account. ...

	<li><a href="https://corfield.org/blog/post.cfm/clojure-in-the-enterprise">Clojure in the Enterprise?</a> - about the differences between the Clojure and the enterprise java  (with heavy frameworks such as JPA, JSF, mutable state) ways and difficulties of introducing Clojure due to old-fashioned thinking, limited skills, etc. "<em>Take away objects, mutable state, variables, loops... a lot of Java developers are immediately all at sea and have no idea how to solve even basic problems. They'll try to bend Clojure to their OOP way of thinking and they'll most likely fail.</em>"
World Singles' experience with Clojure: "<em>We love Clojure. It's made development a lot more fun. We're able to solve harder problems, make changes faster, leverage multi-core concurrency more effectively, and we have a much smaller code base to maintain.</em>"</li>
