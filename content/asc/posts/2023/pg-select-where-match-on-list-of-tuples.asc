{:title "PostgreSQL & JDBC: How to select rows matching pairs of values"

Given a _sequence_ of pairs of (id, version) in code, how do you _efficiently_ select all records in your DB that match? You can construct a long string with `SELECT ... WHERE (id = 'a' AND version = 1) OR (id = 'b' AND version = 20) OR ...` but that's not very efficient. If you only had a single value then, in PostgreSQL, you could use `id=ANY(?)` and pass in a char array. But what if you have multiple conditions/columns that must match? `Unnest` to the rescue!

Here is the complete solution:

```clojure
(let [id+ver-pairs [[\a,1], [\b,20], [\c,1]]
      ids (map first id+ver-pairs)
      versions (map last id+ver-pairs)]
   (next.jdbc/execute! conn
      ["select * from thing t join unnest(?,?) as x(id,version)
                              on (t.id = x.id and t.version = x.version)"
        (into-array ids) (into-array versions)]))
```

Bonus: Producing the SQL with https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql[HoneySQL]:

```clojure
(honey/format
  (-> (hh/select :*)
      (hh/from [:thing :t])
      (hh/join [[:unnest
                 (into-array [\a \b \c])
                 (into-array [1 20 1])]
                [[:'x :id :version]]] ; <1>
               [:and [:= :t.id :x.id]
                [:= :t.version :x.version]]))
  {:quoted true})
```
<1> The quote in `:'x` ensures that the name stays as-is, i.e. `x(id,version)` - otherwise it would be upper-cased (even though it doesn't really matter, since in effect the name would be unquoted and thus case-insensitive, as identifiers are by default). See https://cljdoc.org/d/com.github.seancorfield/honeysql/2.5.1103/doc/readme#functions[Usage > Functions]: "`If a keyword begins with ', the function name is formatted as a SQL entity rather than being converted to uppercase and having hyphens - converted to spaces`".

TIP: https://clojurians.slack.com/team/U08JKUHA9[Isak mentioned] that he has been using `json_to_recordset` with an array of objects, as in `join json_to_recordset(?::json) as x(id int, version int) ...`, though it is possible my way is more efficient.

## Bonus: Leverage composites for tuple matches with a subquery

A tip from my awesome colleague Fredrik RÃ¸tnes. In my case, the ids and versions come from the client app. But what if they come elsewhere from the DB? Here we can leverage composites:

```sql
SELECT * FROM thing WHERE ((id, version)) IN (SELECT DISTINCT other_id, other_version FROM other_table)
```

and in Honey:

```clojure
(honey/format
    (-> (hh/select :*)
        (hh/from :thing)
        (hh/where
          [:in
           (hh/columns :id :version)
           (-> (hh/select-distinct :other-id :other-version)
               (hh/from :other-table))])))
```
