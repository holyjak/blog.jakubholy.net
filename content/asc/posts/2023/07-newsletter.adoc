Welcome to the Holy Dev newsletter, which brings you gems I found on the web, updates from my blog, and a few scattered thoughts.
You can get the next one into your mailbox if you link:/me/subscribe[subscribe].

== What is happening

I have written two blog posts. The first one is link:/2023/book-highlights-escaping-the-build-trap/[my highlights from the excellent book Escaping the Build Trap]. Taster: "It doesn't matter how good you are at making software, if you are building the wrong thing. Melissa Perri's Escaping the Build Trap is an excellent book about fostering culture focused on customer's problems and producing value." Highly recommended!

The other blogpost is link:/2023/when-not-to-use-fulcro/[When not to use Fulcro?]: _"Fulcro is great for writing non-trivial, full-stack business SPA web applications, which display and modify data from a general data store. But it can’t possibly be perfect for every kind of web app. So when is it less then a perfect fit? Possibly still usable, but not as beneficial?"_

The biggest event of the month for me has been my London Clojurians talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2wzLP4Wbpg[Why you need Fulcro, the web framework to build apps better, faster] (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17hjgSHUBALz-4phPfRnyEfi-n76-QyZjL7UaaCv9_bA/edit#slide=id.g22b067a9a61_0_20[slides]). I think it went pretty well and I got some positive feedback.

I have finally finished the Fulcro Cookbook recipe https://fulcro-community.github.io/fulcro-cookbook/dynamic-recursion/dynamic-recursion.html[Solving mutually recursive elements with lazy loading with hooks and dynamic components], so have a look! Many thanks to Tony and Aram, who were instrumental in making it happen. (Gene Kim inspired me to add a live demo of the app, which I haven't yet gotten to.)

Other than that, I got some time to read, as you can see in the Gems section below :-). My favorite article was Thomas Heller's https://code.thheller.com/blog/shadow-cljs/2023/07/13/the-lost-arts-of-cljs-frontend.html[The Lost Arts of CLJS Frontend], reminding us that we can use browser APIs directly, and that we can built anything from super-lightweight cljs frontends ~ htmx to library-heavy SPAs. The thing I haven't read yet, which I am most looking forward to studying, is the https://recife.pfeodrippe.com/notebooks/recife/notebook/reasoning.html[Recife Guide] (Recife if Clojure wrapper for TLA+, a formal method language for specifying systems with temporal properties and verifying that their behavior is correct.)

The thing I am most excited about is https://redplanetlabs.com/[Red Planet Labs] coming out of the stealth-mode with their 100x productivity programming language/platform in couple of days. (I've have written https://www.tumblr.com/holyjak/717246727730724864/tour-of-our-250k-line-clojure-codebase[about RPL's efforts] before.)

One more thing - I haven't mentioned previously that I maintain my https://gist.github.com/holyjak/da15f613376bf7015385a7cd899ee3e8[Fulcro Field Notes] and similarly, https://gist.github.com/holyjak/207ed33c9ee7e003b9a779fa47c32d91[Fulcro RAD Field Notes], which are collections of observations from my practice and from Slack. In the former one, there is a new https://gist.github.com/holyjak/da15f613376bf7015385a7cd899ee3e8#tony-on-when-to-use-hooks-2023-07-24[note on when to use React hooks in Fulcro]. (See also the Cookbook's recipes' insights section for https://fulcro-community.github.io/fulcro-cookbook/dynamic-recursion/dynamic-recursion.html#_insights[why using hooks is not ideal].)

=== Other Fulcro highlights

Gene Kim (yes, the one) has published a https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4aJznIeHN6xSZTcbibLEOSF5kQt9dt1S[series of recordings pair-programming sessions] between himself and Tony Kay (and sometimes myself), as he builds a couple of Fulcro RAD-based applications. He came to Fulcro as a true beginner, so everyone can learn something from these. (You can find it listed at https://fulcro-community.github.io/main/awesome-fulcro/README.html[Awesome Fulcro].) Bunch of these have pretty detailed descriptions, which helps you find the parts interesting to you. You will learn a lot about design both in general, and in the context of Fulcro.

Rationale: Remove the burden of switching between code and .css and inventing names to bind them together.  Using Tailwind CSS is a great alternative, but requires additional JS tooling. Gaols: 0 runtime and code size impact, expressivity of Tailwind with access to all of CSS, no extra tooling, integrates seamlessly with external CSS. Its css macro accepts CSS DSL and returns a css class name: {:className (css :px-4 :shadow {:color "red"})}. (Top-level keywords are mostly same as <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/padding">tailwind aliases</a>, maps are raw css property (as kwd) + value pairs; numeric values represent <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-spacing#default-spacing-scale">Tailwind spacing scale</a> (1 = 0.25rem, 2 = 0.5, ...), kwd values are aliases (to Tailwind's or your own).)

Just leaving it here for long winter nights...</span></p><p><span class="link">👓 <a href="https://quii.dev/HTMX_is_the_Future">Chris James - HTMX is the Future</a> [webdev, opinion]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">HTMX is for building server-driven webapps, where frontend is sprinkled with few tags to fetch and insert fragments of HTML via Ajax - contrary to the frontend-heavy SPAs. This (biased) article explores its advantages. "All HTMX does, is make the browser better at hypermedia by giving us more options regarding what can trigger an HTTP request and allowing us to update a part of the page rather than a full page reload."</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Pitch: Get rid of the complexity of Single-Page Apps, and move development back to backend. Discusses the cost of SPAs (complexity, changing tooling, managing state on both FE and BE, etc.). HTMX embraces the architectural approach of REST (of returning self-describing hypermedia to thin clients) and "it augments the browser, improving its hypermedia capabilities and making it simpler to deliver a rich client experience without having to write much JavaScript if any at all." A bunch more of great points (the cost of FE x BE divide, fast moving FE landscape, duplication of biz/authx logic, etc.).</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Recommended to pair with Thomas Heller's critique of HTMX in his <a href="https://code.thheller.com/blog/shadow-cljs/2023/07/13/the-lost-arts-of-cljs-frontend.html">The Lost Arts of CLJS Frontend</a>. His main point is that the elementary approach HTMX uses (adding to HTML anotations that JS hooks into) is nothing new, and has a well known problem - scaling. Namely, the library provides a set of functionality when (not if!) you need something slightly more or different, you need to work around it, becoming more and more complex. Thomas argues for a middle ground: lightweight Cljs frontends. (You don't always need SPAs!) I'll leave with this pitch: "On the surface this is exactly what HTMX does, however I want to present how to do this in CLJS in a scalable way, which takes you from tiny snippets of functionality to full-blown SPA if needed." (Side note: <a href="https://biffweb.com/p/how-to-use-electric/">Biff demoes</a> how to enhance htmx with e.g. Electric.)</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">More highlights: "[..] the amount you have to learn to be effective [with React] is unreasonable for most applications".</span></p><p><span class="link">👓 <a href="https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon">mockoon/mockoon: Mockoon is the easiest and quickest way to run mock APIs locally. No remote deployment, no account...</a> [webdev, tool]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">I haven't tried this, as writing a simple mock API in Clojure is enough for me, but it could be useful to someone. One of 20 projects in GitHub Accelerator 2023. About: "It's a desktop application and a <a href="https://mockoon.com/cli/">CLI</a> that help you work faster with APIs by mocking them. Integrate third-party APIs quicker, improve your integration tests, speed up your development, etc."</span></p><p><span class="link">👓 <a href="https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks">formbricks/formbricks: Open Source Surveys & Experience Management Solution</a> [webdev, tool, SaaS]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">[Self-]Hosted (in-app, I believe) mini-sureys to gather data from your users for data-driven product decisions. One of 20 projects in GitHub Accelerator 2023.</span></p><p><span class="link">👓 <a href="https://code.thheller.com/blog/shadow-cljs/2023/07/13/the-lost-arts-of-cljs-frontend.html">The Lost Arts of CLJS Frontend</a> [webdev, opinion, clojure]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Thomas looks at the <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/holyjak/723477159131365376/chris-james-htmx-is-the-future?source=share">recent craze around HTMX</a>, discusses its limitations, and shows us how to take control and build as simple or as complex apps on the HTMX - SPA scale as we need to. Refreshing!</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">The problem with HTMX is that it doesn't scale, because it provides a set of functionality and when you need something slightly more or different, you start running into problems.</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Instead, you can take essentially building DIY HTMX using pure JS and interop as a starting point, and add libraries and utilities as your needs grow. Here you can make it as convenient as HTMX, but you retain full control. Thomas then demonstrates how to use e.g. re-frame for a tiny part of the UI, which needs more FE behavior.</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Thomas mentions that "Forms are probably one of the more complex things in web development. You might want to add client side validation, dynamic fields, image uploads or whatever else." Thus I guess this is one place where HTMX would become too limited.</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Also check out the follow up posts <a href="https://code.thheller.com/blog/shadow-cljs/2023/07/16/applying-the-art-of-cljs-frontend.html">Applying the Art of CLJS Frontend</a> (demo of rewriting Biff's <a href="https://github.com/jacobobryant/eelchat">eelchat</a> from htmx+hyperscript to DIY lightweight cljs with <a href="https://github.com/thheller/shadow-graft">shadow-graft</a> ) and <a href="https://code.thheller.com/blog/shadow-cljs/2023/07/18/mastering-the-art-of-cljs-frontend.html">Mastering the Art of CLJS Frontend</a> (digging into working with DOM from Cljs).</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Aide: <a href="https://github.com/thheller/shadow-graft">shadow-graft</a> is a small lib for integrating FE and BE code: define multimethods for "progressive enhancement" on FE (taking BE-supplied data and a DOM element), and "call" them when constructing the html on backend, targetting them at closeby elements: [:a ...] (graft "ask-before-navigating" :prev-sibling {:my-data nil}). Thus FE defines reusable pieces of "progressive enhancements", while BE ddecides where to apply them - i.e. the information what needs to be enhanced is collocated with the target DOM, instead of being spread far and wide.</span></p><p><span class="link">👓 <a href="https://kwill.dev/posts/datomic-cloud-multi-tenancy/">Datomic Cloud multi-tenancy</a> [clojure, architecture, datomic]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Approaches to, considerations, and trade-offs related to implementing multi-tenancy in Datomic <em>Cloud</em>. </span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">By database - minimal code and strong data isolation x limited scalability (up to 100s perhaps, depending on the concrete case and sizes?). You could distribute the DBs over multiple Datomic Systems, for a greater cost. "In cases where we expect thousands of tenants, such a B2C apps, the cost element becomes unreasonable."</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Shared database & DIY data separation - e.g. add [entity, tenant] for each entity & include in queries (possibly wrap Datomic API with one adding these checks). More difficult with GDPR (since we can't simpli delete a DB, and Cloud lacks excision).</span></p><p><span class="link">👓 <a href="https://favila.github.io/2023-04-18/datomic-choosing-ref-direction/">Choosing a Direction for Datomic Ref Types</a> [datomic, performance] - <q>Datomic Reference attributes associate two entities together, but also have a required direction. Which direction should you choose?</q></span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Rule of thumb: for hgih-cardinality one<>many relations, make the "many" entities point to the "one" entity (≈ the contained entity to the container) - this keeps EAVT segments for the one smaller. d/history for the one is more readable; for high-cardinality and high-churn attributes, it would be dominated by changes to the references. Cheaper to enforce the "to one" direction (i.e. a passanger is only in a single car). Quite deep!</span></p><p><span class="link">👓 <a href="https://corfield.org/blog/2023/04/16/calva-joyride-portal/">Calva, Joyride, and Portal</a> [clojure, productivity]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Sean's tuned melange of Calva, Joyride, and Portal.

It can turn complicated byte formats into Clojure data structures, allowing for easy use of custom network protocols and C libraries. It can also turn Clojure data structures into compact byte representations, allowing for efficient use of bandwidth and disk.

Do not lump all unexpected errors at the top level together into a single, generic 500 "Internal Error". Look at what kind of exceptions occur, distinguish the truly unexpected (likely bugs) from transient network errors and high load problems. Translate the exception into something more useful, e.g. by adding a more specific error code and message for a given exc. <em>category</em>. The messages should be good enough for other developers, QA, maybe other employees, or service-to-service communication, likely not end-users. Adjust accordingly for them.

I learn well from books and started with the Joy of Clojure, which might not be a good first book, but it kept my interest up to continue going deeper and deeper. But what really helped it click was doing almost all of the 4Clojure exercises (now at <a href="https://4clojure.oxal.org/">https://4clojure.oxal.org/</a>)… and then doing them again. The second time through I was amazed at how much I’d learned – the solutions tended to be shorter, more functional… more beautiful. Looking at other solutions can help. As other respondents said, the functional paradigm shift is hard to get your head around, but once it gels, it changes everything.</blocquote></span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">By <a href="https://clojureverse.org/t/2-years-of-clojure-and-it-still-isnt-clicking-what-am-i-doing-wrong/10187/9">eigenhombre at ClojureVerse</a></span></p><p><span style="white-space: pre-line;"><em>axllent/mailpit - mail server for testing in CI</em><br /></span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;"></span><br /><span class="link">👓 <a href="https://github.com/axllent/mailpit?ref=console.dev">axllent/mailpit - mail server for testing in CI</a> [testing, tool]</span><br /><span style="white-space: pre-line;">Acts as a mail server (SMTP or API) for testing emails from your code.
