_An extended transcript of my talk at https://devfest.no/[DevFest Norway 2020] (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LkKnbnvBmmCmN1oFoTd9hSB4oeY_arIuFdHdkfG2Iks/edit?usp=sharing[slides here])._

Do you also love creating useful (web)apps and get easily frustrated by any friction in the development process? I will compare Redux + REST with a full-stack, component-centric solution based on a graph API (think GraphQL) that I came to love. You might not be able to use the same framework - Fulcro - but you can still look for similar, more developer-friendly solutions that implement some of the same ideas and provide some of the same functionality. We will discuss REST vs. Graph APIs, networking, error handling, and more. (You should have an idea about React, Redux, and GraphQL to gain most out of this.)


WARNING: *Work in progress - to be finished in a few days.*

## Introduction

I want to talk to you about the pain of web development.
Especially related to getting data from a backend displayed on the screen
and to understanding the code of a UI you haven’t written.

I’ve worked on three React apps where I had to make what felt like an insane amount of changes across multiple files
to display a new kind of data. Until I said “enough, there must be a better way!”
And there is, at least one.

## The message

The key point of this talk is this:

> Don’t settle for the mainstream, for an “industrial best practice”, for what everyone else is doing.
> Keep searching for better tools, less friction in your development flow, higher productivity, for better developer experience, perhaps better languages, for what is best for your case.

## Redux & REST vs. Fulcro & Graph API

I am going to compare and contrast one widespread, mainstream solution - Redux & REST -
with the innovative approach provided by Fulcro & Graph API.

## Talk inspired by Fulcro (+ Pathom):

* Full-stack, batteries included ClojureScript framework @ React
* Based on a few simple ideas...
* ... and adaptability as a key feature
  (Meaning that you can use the hooks it provides to override or extend its key behaviors and thus adapt it to the unique needs of your project.)

The ideas:

* Graph API (∋ GraphQL)
** Client declares its data needs
* Co-location & fat components
* (Normalized data)

Batteries included:

* Error handling, “loading...”
* Load sync/async/on-demand
* UISM, routing, & more

### The idea

#### Graph API (∋ GraphQL) [provided by Pathom]

The first idea is to use a Graph API instead of REST.

While with REST you have multiple endpoints, each pushing you all the data it has,
a Graph API - the best known example being GraphQL - provides you with a single endpoint that
can serve all (or most) of your data needs. And it is the client who decides what data it gets by explicitly querying for it.

It is similar to SQL - you send a query to your database and get data back. But while in the case of SQL the data is in the form of a table, in the case of a Graph API it is a graph, most typically a tree.
And that's a perfect match for the UI because it is a tree of components.
Imagine that you want to display a list of all female players, and for each player you want her name and home address, and for each home address you only want the city. This is a tree in the UI and in data.

A single endpoint means less configuration, UI-shaped data means no need for crazy client-side data transformations.

#### Co-location & fat components

The second idea is co-location.

Let's take a step back: Why do we create web applications? To enable users to interact with our systems. So they are, in essence, user interfaces. And the most important things in UIs are UI components.

To understand what a component does and why it exists, I don't want to search through four different files. I want everything right next to the body of the component, or at most a click away^*^. And that is the idea of co-location: include all the key information with the component. What data it needs. Which route is it under. What is the ID attribute of the associated data entity. How it wants to handle errors.

Actually, Fulcro goes even a step further. Its (stateful) UI components are expected to map to and to describe your (UI-centric view of) data entities, such as Person, PersonList, Address. So they are ultimate "source of truth" in your application.

^*^) Literally one click away - Fulcro is also optimized for developer experience, in particular for navigability. The important pieces look like standard functions/references so your editor's built-in navigation (control/command-click) works on them.

#### Normalized data

The last key idea is to store the data at the client not as it comes, as a graph, but normalized, deduplicated, in a map from entity ID to entity properties (whose values can be _references_ to other entities).

Thus, if I have two players living at the same home address and I update it, both will show the new, updated value.

This prevents a whole class of defects due to data inconsistency.

## Code time!

Let's see how that looks in practice. Imagine you have a webshop and have been asked to show a list of "hot deals" - and the data should only be loaded when the component is displayed.

(I will only show the most important parts of the code, it is not complete.)

### Solution 1: Redux + REST

This is a standard Redux + REST solution based on what I have seen on production projects.

We start with the UI itself.

.HotDeals.jsx
[source,javascript,highlight='3-5']
----
export default HotDeals = Redux.connect(
  (state) => _.pick(state, ["deals", "dealsError", "dealsLoading"]),
  { loadHotDeals } // defined below
)(function HotDeals({deals, dealsError, dealsLoading, loadHotDeals}){
  React.useEffect(() => loadHotDeals(), []) // on mount
  if (!deals || dealsLoading) return <p>Loading....</p>
  if (dealsError)             return <p>Something went wrong</p>
  return                      <ul>{deals.map(deal => <Deal {...deal}/>)}</ul>
})
----

.actions.js
[source,javascript]
----
export function loadHotDeals() {
  return {
    type: "LOAD_HOT_DEALS",
    promise: fetchHotDeals()
  }
}
----

.backend-client.js
[source,javascript]
----
export function fetchHotDeals() {
  return fetch('https://backend/hot-deals')
     .then(res => res.json())
}
----

```javascript
export function fetchHotDeals() {
  return fetch('https://backend/hot-deals')
     .then(res => res.json())
}
```

.reducer.js
[source,javascript]
----
import { handle } from 'redux-pack'; // 1 Promise action -> 4 events

export function reducer(state = myInitialState, action) {
  const { type, payload } = action;
  switch (type) {
    case "LOAD_HOT_DEALS":
      // The UI expects deals, dealsLoading, dealsError:
      return handle(state, action, {
        start: prevState => ({
          ...prevState,
          dealsLoading: true, dealsError: null
        }),
        finish: prevState =>
          ({ ...prevState, dealsLoading: false }),
        failure: prevState =>
          ({ ...prevState, dealsError: payload }),
        success: prevState =>
          ({ ...prevState, deals: payload })
      });
    // ... repeat ∀ data sources ...
  }
}
----

.backend.js
[source,javascript]
----
// ################################################### BACKEND
// BACKEND - BUSINESS: webshop.js
async function hotDeals(env) { return ...; }

// BACKEND - PLUMBING: controller.js
router.get('/hot-deals', async(req, res) =>
   res.json(await webshop.hotDeals(req.env)));
----

### Solution 2: Fulcro + Graph API

Let's see how it looks with Fulcro and Graph API. See the frontend code below - and notice how much shorter it is.

First we `defsc` - **def**ine the **s**tateful **c**omponent - `HotDeals`, a React component that mirrors the one we saw above. It will get the self-reference `this` and `props`, which will include `deals`.

There is one major difference however - aside of the body itself, we also provide additional metadata, especially the query: `:query [{:deals (fcomp/get-query Deal)} ...]`. It means "I want the `deals` and for each deal whatever the `Deal` component needs." There are a few observations to make: 1) nobody but the component itself needs to know what data in wants; this information is not spread across multiple places as in Redux (i.e. `Redux.connect` and the reducer); 2) the queries do compose - `HotDeals` includes the query of its child `Deal` (without needing to know anything about its details) - so that the query of the root element will include all queries for its descendants and will thus produce data for the whole application.

See the callouts below the code for details.

.frontend.cljs
[source,clojure]
----
;; Syntax: [1, 2, ...] = "array", {:key "value", ...} = map, (something ...) =
;; invoke something (a function, ...)
(defsc HotDeals [this props]
  {:query [{:deals (fcomp/get-query Deal)} [ffetch/marker-table :deals-marker]]  ; <1>
   :use-hooks? true}
  (hooks/use-effect
    (fn [] (ffetch/load!                ; <2>
             this :deals Deal
             {:marker :deals-marker})) ; <3>
    [])
  (let [marker (get props [ffetch/marker-table :deals-marker])]
    (cond
----
<1> The `query` declares what data the component wants; it asks for `deals`, which we
    get from the `props` at +++<i class="conum" data-value="5"></i>+++ to render the list
<2> As before, we ask for the data to be loaded - but thanks to the uniformity of the Graph API
    and to having declared query on the component, we can use the generic, Fulcro-provided
    `load!` function instead of writing our own load/fetchHotDeals
    (telling it "load the deals and for each whatever Deal wants")
<3> ...and we also ask it to plug into the framework-provided loading/result tracking
    and give us the "status marker" called `:deals-marker` so that we can question it later
<4> We leverage the marker to check whether the loading is in progress
<5> We leverage the marker to check whether the loading has failed
<6> As before, we display a list of the individual deals
<7> Note: the same `:deals` is referred to in 1, 2, and 6

Highlights: 1) declarative data needs; 2) built-in load!; 3) built-in tracking of loading/failed.

.backend.clj
[source,clojure]
----
;; BACKEND - BUSINESS: webshop.clj
(defn hot-deals [env] ...)

;; BACKEND - PLUMBING: graph-api.clj
(pc/defresolver hot-deals [env _]
  {::pc/input  #{}
   ::pc/output [{:deals [:deal/id :deal/title ...]}]}                            ; (4)
  {:deals (hot-deals env)})
;; NOTE: The output key :deals, (4) matches the key FE queries for

;; In config:
 ... (pc/connect-plugin {::pc/register [hot-deals ...]}) ...
----

## I don't want to...

In the first, Redux and REST solution, we have seen a number of things I don't want to:

I don't want to have to coordinate a change across 2, 3, 4 different files and places.

I don't want to manage failure tracking manually (the `dealsError` prop).

I don't want to manage loading status manually (the `dealsLoading` prop).

And I certainly don't want to do this again and again, for each single endpoint.

I don't want to write data fetching for each endpoint (the `fetchHotDeals` function).
I know I am always getting back JSON and if there is any error, I want the UI component to decide how that should be handled.

I don't want to coordinate loading data from a number of (possibly inter-dependent) endpoints. Graph API can figure this out for me and just give me the data I want, no matter which sources they came and how they depend on each other.

I don't want to manually maintain the consistency of my, possibly duplicated data.

## I want

The second approach, using Fulcro & Graph API, offers a number of things that I want.

I want the minimal friction when getting (new) data from a backend to the UI. In Fulcro I just needed to define the resolver that exposes the data in the backend and then just query for it and use it in my component. You cannot ask for less! (Well, you can. With https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-rad[Fulcro Rapid Application Development] you get the resolvers generated for you.)

I want built-in request status (loading/error) tracking.

I want built-in built-in data fetching and caching. With the uniform Graph API backend and the composable data needs declaration - queries - in the frontend, I can use a generic, framework provided `load!` function.

This is a big one - I want the ability to easily switch loading modes - load all data at once, when the application starts vs. start loading all data at once but only wait for the essential data before displaying the UI, while displaying the secondary data when it arrives vs. loading data on-demand (on click, when a component mounts, ...). I don't want to wait for the slowest data source before displaying anything useful to the users.

## I want a framework that:

... is full-stack and integrated, i.e. where the backend and frontend have been made to work together and where there is minimal friction and boilerplate in getting data from the one to the other. A framework that provides a complete, well-integrated solution to all common needs of non-trivial applications.

I want a framework that has "batteries included" (see below).

I want a framework that is adaptable, where the maintainers are not (presumably) omniscient, making all the decisions for me. I have been burnt repeatedly by running into the walls created by such decisions that were contrary to the needs of a particular project.
Fulcro provides "hooks" that allow me to extend or override its key behaviors - and a lot of deep design thinking went into that - so that I can truly adapt it to the unique needs of my project, as long as I am aligned with its overall philosophy.

### I want a framework that provides:

*A graph API* so that I can simply get the data I need, in the form that suits my UI, and so that only the place - the component - that uses the data need to know about what data it needs. (Though, obviously, the backend must be able to provide it.) I want to be able to declare data needs and compose them into the complete query.

*Co-location & fat components* so that everything important to understand (and create) a component is contained within the component.

*Normalized data* so that I don't need to worry about data duplication and data out-of-sync problems.

### A framework that has batteries included:

* Error handling and tacking, “loading...” status
* 💪 Load data synchronously / asynchronously / on-demand
* 😍 And more goodies that Fulcro offers such as UI State Machines (indispensable when you have any more complicated interaction flow), routing (which SPA doesn't need one?), forms support, & more

## Stuck in the JS land?

Not everybody is as lucky as I am and gets to work with ClojureScript and Fulcro. If you are stuck with JavaScript, have a look at Facebook Relay and GraphQL. Obviously I think they are inferior to the technologies I use but they are still a great improvement over Redux and REST.

## Homework

* Read/watch to learn about why/when GraphQL makes sense (compared to REST)
* Have a look at Relay (or perhaps Apollo?)
* If interested in the technologies I have used:

## Bonus: Data loading: sync / async / on-demand

All at once, for essential data:

```clojure
(df/load! app :blog Blog)
```

Async, for secondary data:

```clojure
(df/load! app :blog Blog {:without #{:comments}})
(df/load! app :blog Blog {:focus [:comments]})
```

On-demand:

```clojure
onClick/Mount: (df/load! this [:comment/id 123] Comment)
```
