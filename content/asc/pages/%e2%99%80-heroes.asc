* *First programmer* - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace[Ada Lovelace] (daughter of Lord Byron); wrote an algorithm to be executed by an early mechanical general-purpose comuting machine in 1840s (14 October is Ada Lovelace Day)
* *First assembly* language - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Booth[Kathleen Booth]

* The *first compiler* and *COBOL*, one of the first high-level programming languages - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper[Grace Hopper] (she was also a rear admiral and is credited with popularizing the term "`debugging.`")
* The first female *recipient of the A.M. Turing Award* - Frances E. Allen, for her "`pioneering contributions to the theory and practice of optimizing compiler techniques that laid the foundation for modern optimizing compilers and automatic parallel execution.`" She was also working on the first compiler that targeted multiple machines and source languages. http://caitiem.com/2015/02/04/tech-wcw-2-frances-e-allen/[More info]
