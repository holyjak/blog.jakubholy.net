Consequently, we should focus on keeping ourselves and our customers happy, not focus on making money. Good reputation and profit is simply a side effect of keeping ourselves and our customers happy. - http://blog.crisp.se/2010/05/08/henrikkniberg/1273272420000[What is Crisp?],  Crisp’s Blog

* http://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404/[Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders] (http://turntheshiparound.com/[website]) - a wonderful story of turning the worst submarine in the navy into the best one by turning everybody into a leader - and thus tapping into all their resources, passion, initiative. Giving people purpose and control over their own work is crucial for effectiveness, especially in a chaotic enironment. Some advices: Focus on excellence, not avoiding mistakes. Empowering others is disempowering - allow them do the job. You perhaps can start to change culture by faking it at first (e.g. behaving as a proud sailor). Responsibility requires competence - on our job, we are learning every day. Some highlights: "`Lack of certainty is a strength. Certainty is arrogance.`" "`Efforts to monitor the process make the organization less efficient while efforts to improve it make it more efficient.`" "`The best way not to make a mistake is not to do anything or make any decisions.`"
