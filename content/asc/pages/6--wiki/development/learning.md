## Python & programming

1.  Snytax: [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) (by Zed Shaw)
2.  [newcoder.io: Learning more Python via projects](http://newcoder.io/) - an excellent next step; in this tutorial series you will be building real-world apps while learning more of Python. You will play with, Data Visualization, APIs, Web Scraping, Networks, GUI.

## Tools

#### Git

  - [git - the simple (visual) guide](http://rogerdudler.github.com/git-guide/) by R. Dudler - a minimalistic yet sufficient intro into git in a rather simple and visual way. Cons: too little about reslving conflicts and tools for merging. I'd also prefer if it recommended rebasing over merging. Has also a [git cheatsheet](http://rogerdudler.github.com/git-guide/files/git_cheat_sheet.pdf).
  - [An interactive one-page git cheatsheet](http://www.ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=workspace;) highlighting the differences between stash, workspace, index, local repository, and upstream repository (a.k.a. origin)
