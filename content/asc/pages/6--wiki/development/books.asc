=== Non-Books

The talk http://fora.tv/2010/01/05/Jonah_Lehrer_How_We_Decide[how we decide] helped me to understand that different decision making modes are suitable in different situations and how important it is to understand and be aware of our own thinking/deciding process. Another talk taught me that http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action.html[the most important thing to succeed is to know (and communicate) why]. Finally I got support for my opinion that http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc[what motivates us isn’t money, but purpose, mastery, autonomy]. I summarize these talks in the post link:/2011/11/26/the-3-most-important-things-ive-learned-this-year/[The 3 Most Important Things I’ve Learned This Year (2011)].

* http://www.amazon.com/Difficult-Conversations-Discuss-What-Matters-ebook/dp/B004CR6ALA/[Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most] 5* - handle difficult conversations at work and with loved ones by focusing on a "`learning conversation`" - explore and share the underlying emotions, the impact on one’s identity and self-image, and discuss what happened / should happen without blaming or judging but with acknowledging the contributions of each party and the fact that everyone’s "`story`" matters and has a grain of truth. Adopt the "`and stance`" (ex.: "`I am devastated about breaking with you - and I still think it is the best thing to do for us) rather than focusing on the conflict-laden all-or-nothing thinking. A lot in common with Nonviolent Communication (importance of exploring and communicating emotions, of avoiding blame and judgement). Quotes:`"__difficult conversations do not just involve feelings, they are at their very core about feelings.__" "`__The point is this: difficult conversations are almost never about getting the facts right. They are about conflicting perceptions, interpretations, and values. [..] Interpretations and judgments are important to explore. In contrast, the quest to determine who is right and who is wrong is a dead end.__`" A http://break-throughconsulting.com/book_reports/Difficult_Conversations.pdf[great overview/summary of the book] by Break Through Consulting (PDF, 16 pages).
