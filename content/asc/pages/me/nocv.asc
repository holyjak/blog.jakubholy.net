Iâ€™m a full-stack developer with affinity for DevOps and scarred by bad and legacy code, with 15 years in the trenches of corporate and startup life. I believe in development as discovery, people, communication. My holy grail is lean thinking with its focus on value, elimination of waste, and being feedback-driven. I love to learn and share, as demonstrated by my blogs https://blog.jakubholy.net[Holy on Dev] and https://wondersofcode.wordpress.com/[Wonders of Code], and to contribute to open source documentation and code. My mission: delivering real & proven value to users quickly and frequently. My vice: questioning all established processes, practices, and values. My dream: working for the greater good.

Experiences from entertainment industry, travel, e-commerce, e-learning, data analysis/business intelligence, integration.
