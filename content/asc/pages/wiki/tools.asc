== Various tools

=== Drawing and diagramming

From text

* https://plantuml.com/[PlantUML] a popular tool for creating diagrams using a text DSL
* https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/[Mermaid] - another popular text DSL
* https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/[Architecture Diagrams in Python] - Diagram as Code - draw your cloud system architecture in Python code

WYSIWYG

* https://www.yworks.com/products/yed[yEd Graph Editor] - "The interface is great. It’s portable. Lots of really cool tricks you can do with diagramming and graph transformations. Many graph import/export options. It has a java-based version that’s just a jar file." Automatic layout algorithms.
* https://diagrams.net[diagrams.net] and its https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases[open source desktop client] - "very feature rich and touch screen friendly, nice sketch and comic effects". Exports/imports many formats.

=== Command line

Quickly jump to a directory based on frequency/clever substring matching:

* https://github.com/rupa/z[z] (zsh, bash) - "`z is the new j, yo`" - also https://github.com/rupa/j2[j2] and the fish clone https://github.com/sjl/z-fish[z-fish]
* http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10585?page=0,0[DirB, Directory Bookmarks for Bash] (http://www.dirb.info/[home]) – moving efficiently among favourite directories (`+s <name>+` to create a bookmark for pwd, `+g <bookmark | relative/abs dir path>+` to enter a dir (=> works both for bookmarks and as a replacement for cd); also support for relative path bookmarks & more; `+sl+` lists bookmakrs in the last used order)
* http://jakemccrary.com/blog/2011/07/25/utilities-i-like-autojump/[Autojump], link:/2011/12/31/most-interesting-links-of-december-2/[described in Dec 11]

== Mini-notes

==== Bash

*Loop with 0-padded numbers* for a number of repetitions (using for and seq, from 1 to 50, outputting 01, 02, .., 50):

[source,bash]
----
for i in $(seq -f '%02g' 1 50); do echo $i; done
----

*Basic math* in Bash (addition, ..; using let for a numerical var and $((<expression>)) for math):

....
let num=0; echo $num; INC="1"; num=$((num+$INC)); echo $num
....

=== Git

* Undo merge: _git reset –hard ORIG_HEAD_ (the pointer ORIG_HEAD is set automatically by Git)
* Unfo file changes: _git co – path/to/file/to/reset [other/files/..]_
* _git whatchanged master.._

=== Vim - useful advanced commands

* Change/delete a text region
** (d|c)i<delim> - Delete|change text up to the given delimiting character; requires that you are inside pair delimiters such as "`…`" or (…); use '`a`' to include the delimiters
* Operations on selections (=> y to copy (yank), dto delete)
** Select lines (e.g. for deletion via '`d`'): S-V
** Select rectangle (e.g. to delete whitespace): C-V
* Search and replace with confirmation: :%s/foo/bar/gc

=== jq - sed for JSON

Ex.: Extract nested structure with select, filter combination

....
// INPUT
{"name":"Sony Xperia Z3 Black",
 "dealerDetails":[
    {"dealerGroup":"webshop","rank":3},{"dealerGroup":"CustomerCentre","rank":3}]}
// COMMAND
jq '. | {name: .name, rank: (.dealerDetails|map(select(.dealerGroup == "webshop"))[0].rank)}'
