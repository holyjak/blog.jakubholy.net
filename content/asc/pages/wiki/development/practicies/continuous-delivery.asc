* http://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/case-continuous-delivery[Jez Humble: The Case for Continuous Delivery] (2/2014) - read to persuade manager about CD: "`Still, many managers and executives remain unconvinced as to the benefits [of CD], and would like to know more about the economic drivers behind CD.`" CD reduces waste: "`[..]online controlled experiments (A/B tests) at Amazon. This approach created hundreds of millions of dollars of value[..],`" reduces risks: "`[..] Etsy, has a great http://www.usievents.com/en/conferences/8-paris-usi-2011/sessions/968-john-allspaw[presentation] which describes how deploying more frequently improves the stability of web services.`" CD makes development cheaper by reducing the cost of non-value-adding activities such as integration and testing. F.ex. HP got dev. costs down by 40%, dev cost/program by 78%

== Notes

=== Why continuous delivery practices?

* Everybody develops on the same branch to prevent integration/merge hell and unexpected issues when a merge "`succeeds`" but causes unexpected side effects (reviving previously removed configuration etc.) - use feature toggles, link:/wiki/development/parallel-design-parallel-change/[parallel change], etc. to make this possible
