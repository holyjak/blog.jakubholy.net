I'm a full-stack developer with affinity for DevOps and scars burnt by bad code, with <span style="color:#00ffff;">13</span> years in the trenches of corporate and startup life. I believe in development as discovery, people, communication. My holy grail is lean thinking with its focus on value, elimination of waste, and being feedback-driven. I love to learn and share, as demonstrated by my blogs The Holy Java and Wonders of Code with 12k monthly views and co-organization of the Oslo Socially Functional Programmers meetup. My mission: delivering real & proven value to users quickly and frequently. My vice: questioning all established processes, practices, and values. My dream: working for the greater good.

Experiences from entertainment industry, travel, e-commerce, e-learning, data analysis/business intelligence, integration.
