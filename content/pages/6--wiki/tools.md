## Command line



Quickly jump to a directory based on frequency/clever substring matching:


  - [z](https://github.com/rupa/z) (zsh, bash) - "z is the new j, yo" - also [j2](https://github.com/rupa/j2) and the fish clone [z-fish](https://github.com/sjl/z-fish)
  - [DirB, Directory Bookmarks for Bash](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10585?page=0,0) ([home](http://www.dirb.info/)) â€“ moving efficiently among favourite directories (`s <name>` to create a bookmark for pwd, `g <bookmark | relative/abs dir path>` to enter a dir (=\> works both for bookmarks and as a replacement for cd); also support for relative path bookmarks & more; `sl` lists bookmakrs in the last used order)
  - [Autojump](http://jakemccrary.com/blog/2011/07/25/utilities-i-like-autojump/), [described in Dec 11](/2011/12/31/most-interesting-links-of-december-2/)




### Bash



**Loop with 0-padded numbers** for a number of repetitions (using for and seq, from 1 to 50, outputting 01, 02, .., 50):

```bash
for i in $(seq -f '%02g' 1 50); do echo $i; done
```


**Basic math** in Bash (addition, ..; using let for a numerical var and $((\<expression\>)) for math):


    let num=0; echo $num; INC="1"; num=$((num+$INC)); echo $num




## Git




  - Undo merge: *git reset --hard ORIG\_HEAD* (the pointer ORIG\_HEAD is set automatically by Git)
  - Unfo file changes: *git co -- path/to/file/to/reset \[other/files/..\]*
  - *git whatchanged master..*




## Vim - useful advanced commands




  - Change/delete a text region
      - (d|c)i\<delim\> - Delete|change text up to the given delimiting character; requires that you are inside pair delimiters such as "..." or (...); use 'a' to include the delimiters
  - Operations on selections (=\> y to copy (yank), dto delete)
      - Select lines (e.g. for deletion via '`d`'): S-V
      - Select rectangle (e.g. to delete whitespace): C-V
  - Search and replace with confirmation: :%s/foo/bar/gc




## jq - sed for JSON



Ex.: Extract nested structure with select, filter combination


    // INPUT
    {"name":"Sony Xperia Z3 Black",
     "dealerDetails":[
        {"dealerGroup":"webshop","rank":3},{"dealerGroup":"CustomerCentre","rank":3}]}
    // COMMAND
    jq '. | {name: .name, rank: (.dealerDetails|map(select(.dealerGroup == "webshop"))[0].rank)}'
    // OUTPUT
    {"name":"Sony Xperia Z3 Black","rank":3}
