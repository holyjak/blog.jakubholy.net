## Heroes




### Dr. W. Edwards Deming



[Edwards Deming](https://deming.org/theman/theories) is the father of a "new management" (post-taylorian), of the Japanese post-war success, of lean thinking, of more human workplaces.

> Consequently, we should focus on keeping ourselves and our customers happy, not focus on making money. Good reputation and profit is simply a side effect of keeping ourselves and our customers happy.

  - [What is Crisp?](https://blog.crisp.se/2010/05/08/henrikkniberg/1273272420000),  Crisp's Blog 5/2010 - this cooperative/company has created two A3: “What is Crisp? - defines their purpose" and "Crisp strategy - defines how the company works and why". Great idea, great content.
  - [Crisp consensus model 2.1](https://blog.crisp.se/2014/03/27/peterantman/crisp-consensus-model-2-1) - Crisp, an IT consultancy, is owned by its members, has no CEO, and decides using consensus (how many people are involved depends on the size and effect of the decision - 1, team, a special group, all)

## Resources




  - [Turn the Ship Around\!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders](https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404/) ([website](https://turntheshiparound.com/)) - a wonderful story of turning the worst submarine in the navy into the best one by turning everybody into a leader - and thus tapping into all their resources, passion, initiative. Giving people purpose and control over their own work is crucial for effectiveness, especially in a chaotic enironment.
    Some advices: Focus on excellence, not avoiding mistakes. Empowering others is disempowering - allow them do the job. You perhaps can start to change culture by faking it at first (e.g. behaving as a proud sailor). Responsibility requires competence - on our job, we are learning every day.
    Some highlights: "Lack of certainty is a strength. Certainty is arrogance." "Efforts to monitor the process make the organization less efficient while efforts to improve it make it more efficient." "The best way not to make a mistake is not to do anything or make any decisions."
