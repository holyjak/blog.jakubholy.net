Notion:

  - ? - I haven't read/seen the book
  - ?? - I do not have any idea if it is good or not

Java:

  - ? [Head First Java](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Java-Kathy-Sierra/dp/0596009208/) - reportedly good
  - [Effective Java, 2nd Edition (Bloch)](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-2nd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683/) is supposed to be a required read by many
  - A good [Oracle Certified Professional, Java SE 6 Programmer](https://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=458&get_params=p_track_id:JSE6Prog) study guide to get a solid overview of the basics and corner cases, once you know Java itself
  - And if you want to do any serious web programming, [Java Concurrency in Practise](https://www.amazon.com/Java-Concurrency-Practice-Brian-Goetz/dp/0321349601/) is likely pretty useful to avoid many pitfalls
  - ?? [Think: Java How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](https://www.greenteapress.com/thinkapjava/) (online and pdf)

Java Web Dev:

  - ?? [Beginning JSP, JSF and Tomcat: Java Web Development](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-JSP-JSF-Tomcat-Development/dp/1430246235/), 2nd ed. (2012, 436 pages)
